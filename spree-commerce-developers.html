    <a href="https://spreecommerce.com" target="_blank">Spree Commerce</a> is a flexible open source platform built with Ruby on Rails. We’ve been developing Rails applications since 2007 and this experience enables us to handle even the most challenging Spree implementations. 
  </p>
  <p class="editable">
  Our Spree developers are well-versed in the code base and understand how to correctly use variants, taxons, properties, options, and prototypes to build a store that’s easy to navigate, manage, and grow.
  </p>

  <p class="editable">
  We know when and how to customize your Spree site to improve the front-end user experience and back-end work flow. We can upgrade to a newer version of Spree, or shift over to Solidus.</p>

  <p>We’re always looking for opportunities to improve performance, from making your site faster to increasing your conversion rate.</p>
