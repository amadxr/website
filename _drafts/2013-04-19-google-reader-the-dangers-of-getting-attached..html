<p>In 2005 Google launched <a href="http://google.com/reader" target="_blank">Google Reader</a>.&nbsp; Reader is a service which allows you to subscribe to multiple RSS feeds and view any changes to them through a simple client.&nbsp; The upshot of this was that you subscribe to websites (blogs, news, podcasts etc.) which were updated periodically and receive updates without having to check up yourself.&nbsp; Incredibly useful.<!--more-->&nbsp; Google also built an <a href="/blog/crafting-apis">API </a>which allowed lots of third parties to build apps on top of the Google Reader service to pull down updates.&nbsp; Unfortunately Google has decided to shutdown Google Reader and this, of course, has knock on effects for anyone or any service depending on it.</p>
<p>There are quite a few services out there which may work as a replacement.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.feedly.com/" target="_blank">Feedly</a>, <a href="http://newsblur.com/">Newsblur </a>and <a href="http://theoldreader.com/">TheOldReader </a>are worth looking at.&nbsp; It's difficult to guess where this will go.&nbsp; Running a system which pulls in millions of feeds every few minutes or hours and updates millions more clients is no small undertaking, which is why so much has been built on top of Google Reader.&nbsp; Will there be one killer reader to rule them all again?</p>
<p>It's certainly worth keeping track of where your data is, what services you rely on, how easily you can export your data and how quickly you can shift to another product / service if all else fails.&nbsp; Here at Resolve Digital we take data portability seriously and with any of our solutions it is simple to move from place to place because we use services which facilitate this.&nbsp; That said, if you're thinking of building a product on top of someone else's service, think very carefully before committing too much, especially if you don't have a fallback option.</p>
