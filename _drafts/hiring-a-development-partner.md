*“It was great meeting you and the team this morning. Rarely does a prospective client come along who seems like such a great fit. We’re confident this will be the start of a long and mutually beneficial working relationship between our two companies.”*

I wrote that email back in November 2013. But it was not meant to be. Instead of signing our Master Service Agreement, the prospect replied:

*“We believe that your company will be the one, not only to make […] a great product, but will also have the expertise needed to ensure the code is efficient, security flaws are minimal, plus your knowledge of the US market will help us get a foothold there.”*

**And then they hired another agency.** Why? They were up-front about their reason: Lower hourly rates.

Two-plus years later, they circled back with this update.

*“I wish that we had gone with a company like you guys and I no doubt would not be in the mess I am in. [A…a] turned out to be spaghetti coders, so we moved to a local group called [E…l]. They have proved a disaster too and I now have a completely broken Xero integration. Losing customers daily. You live and you learn.”*

> It is so difficult, when faced with a limited budget, to resist the allure of the low-priced option. But the risk is enormous.

Application development is not a commodity. Experience matters. Expertise matters. What seems like a bargain rarely turns out to be one in retrospect. It isn’t the first time we’ve heard this sad story, and it’s not going to be the last.&nbsp;

So how do *we* address this situation? By thinking strategically. By defining an MVP and getting it launched so real people start using it. By architecting a flexible solution we can expand upon. By delivering the greatest value we can within your project budget.

It’s not that there aren’t trade-offs. There most certainly are. But compromising on code quality or hoping inexperienced developers will know how to solve tough technical problems doesn't lead to happy endings.

If you're [looking for a development partner](/hire-us/), remember, you get what you pay for.
