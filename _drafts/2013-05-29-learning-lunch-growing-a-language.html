<p><a href="http://rubyrogues.com/097-rr-book-club-patterns-of-enterprise-architecture-with-martin-fowler/" target="_blank">Recently mentioned</a> on the <a href="http://rubyrogues.com/" target="_blank">RubyRogues</a> podcast was the keynote from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OOPSLA">OOPSLA</a> '98, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ahvzDzKdB0">Growing a Language</a>, by Guy Steele. On that recommendation we dedicated Learning Lunch over the last two weeks to watching the whole thing.</p>

<p>While the talk uses Java as the reference language, its topic applies to all programming languages and has been actively discussed in the Ruby community for a while now. As well as being a interesting topic, the talk itself was engaging, intriguing, and amusing. Mr. Steele is a good speaker. I won't spoil it for you though, you'll just have to watch it to understand why it uses the best example I have ever seen in a talk.</p>
<p>Mr. Steele explains that as programs have become more complex they resemble languages themselves and therefore the language design of a programming language needs to be a pattern for language designs. Languages need to be designed to be extensible and to accept the input of their users.</p>
<p>There are many aspects of Ruby that make it a wonderful language in this regard. In fact, it is common for programs and libraries to define Domain Specific Languages which resemble a generic programming language even more closely than the rest of the program. Even with this great level of power and extensibility for programmers that Ruby provides it will be important going forward for Ruby's designers to keep in mind <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar" target="_blank">the Cathedral and the Bazaar</a> as Mr. Steele relates them to language design.</p>
<p>At 15 years, this was by far the oldest video we've watched. Someone kindly interspersed it with PowerPoint versions of the pages he displayed on an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overhead_projector" target="_blank">overhead projector</a> during the talk. The only bad thing about the talk is that the video periodically skips by a small amount. If you have any interest in programming language design, linguistics, or just quirky talks, I highly recommend it.</p>
