<p>Last week the programming community lost one of its greats, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Weirich" target="_blank">Jim Weirich</a>. I only met him once, but that one time I did have the pleasure of having my mind blown by his talk. In Jim's honor and following his passion for learning, we watched his last talk on Confreaks, <a title="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/2876-rubyconf2013-the-big-picture" href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/2876-rubyconf2013-the-big-picture" target="_blank">The Big Picture</a>.</p>
<p>After an introduction that used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nighthawks" target="_blank">Edward Hopper's Nighthawks</a> as an example of the adage "a picture is worth a thousand words" Jim explained how and why diagrams of programs are useful, even in Ruby, a nicely expressive programming language. </p>
<p>I learned Unified Modeling Language (UML) at university where we used Java as the primary programming language. UML diagrams have a bad rap for being verbose and a waste of time. However, Jim described using them as a limited sketch to convey an idea. Used thus they provide insight that can be missed when just reading code. More useful than an extra tool in your belt is learning how to use an existing tool better.</p>
<p>Using examples of his own code Jim showed where he discovered oddities and possibly bad design by sketching out UML diagrams of the projects. We were left wondering whether he had put that knowledge to use in the months between the talk and his death. What is sure is that there are people in the community who will step up to continue his work and many more who have been touched and inspired by him over the years. Farewell.</p>
