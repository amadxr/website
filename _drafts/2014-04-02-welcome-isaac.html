<p>Isaac first encountered the Web in 1996, when he was studying mathematics at the University of Canterbury. He created an HTML page on GeoCities and determined that the whole web idea probably had legs. (Interesting bit of trivia: GeoCities was the third-most visited site on the web when it was acquired by Yahoo! in 1999. It was shut down in 2009.)</p>
<p>After a few yearsâ€™ diversion as a high school mathematics teacher, Isaac returned to university to study Computer Science and started his own full-service web design and development business.</p>
<p>He has been coding web apps in Ruby on Rails since 2007 and brings a wide range of experience in user-centred design and customer research.</p>
<p>Isaac lives in Christchurch with his wife Kate and their various cats and chickens.</p>
