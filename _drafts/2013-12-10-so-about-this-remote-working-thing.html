<p>There has been a lot of talk lately on the internet (and in our office) about the merits and otherwise of remote working. Marissa Mayer, the current CEO of Yahoo! told <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com.au/why-marissa-mayer-told-remote-employees-to-work-in-an-office--or-quit-2013-2" target="_blank">remote working employees to quit or come back to the office</a> and towards the other end of the spectrum, 37 Signals brought out a book called <a title="http://37signals.com/remote/" href="http://37signals.com/remote/" target="_blank">Remote: Office Not Required</a> which "shows both employers and employees how they can work together, remotely, from any desk, in any space, in any place, anytime, anywhere."</p>
<p>Here at Resolve Digital we have people in New Zealand, San Francisco, Canada and now Florida. You might think this would cause some pretty big headaches regarding collaboration, but it really doesn't. We have a <a href="https://slack.com" title="https://slack.com" target="_blank">Slack</a> chat room which everyone stays logged in to. With the timezones we're in there's at least 4-5 hours of overlap, which definitely helps smooth out workflow when you want to bounce ideas back and forth.</p>
<p>There are also some really great tools available specifically to ease development. I've been experimenting with tmux and even gave a short <a href="http://talks.ruby.org.nz/2013/tmux-lightning/" target="_blank">presentation at the local ruby meetup</a>. What tmux and other tools like it do, is allow someone to share your work environment (your shell session) so that they can see exactly what you're typing as you type it, and also make their own edits directly into the code. It's quite like Google docs but for your developing environment.</p>
<p>There are also some really nice collaboration tools coming out - like <a href="http://screenhero.com/" target="_blank">Screenhero</a> and <a href="http://www.sugarbox.io/" target="_blank">Sugarbox</a> as well as the usuals like Skype.</p>

<p>Suffice to say, working remotely is doable.  It allows employees to have the flexibility to work from home on those days when it's necessary, and it also means you're not constrained in finding workers in your immediate locality. There are 7 billion of us on the planet, chances are that all the best developers aren't located in your home town... (well, unless your home town is Christchurch ;)</p>
