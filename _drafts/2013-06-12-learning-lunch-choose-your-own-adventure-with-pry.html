The ones where you have to make a decision (turn left, turn right, open the locked door which may hide a monster behind it). One of my personal favorites was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Warlock_of_Firetop_Mountain" target="_blank">The Warlock of Firetop Mountain</a>.</p>

<p>Writing code, believe it or not, is a lot like defeating a warlock. The video we watched for this week's learning lunch: '<a href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/2467-railsconf2013-pry-the-good-parts" target="_blank">Pry - The Good Parts</a>' by Conrad Irwin, helps when you get stuck in a coding maze.</p>
<p>When you're stuck in a maze, it would be extremely helpful to try a few different dead ends without having to start again from the beginning each time. According to Conrad, 60% of a developers' time is spent debugging code which isn't working quite the way it should.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/pry/pry" target="_blank">Pry</a> allows you to jump into the maze, try a few different approaches to solving a problem, and then get back to the next task.</p>
<p>With Pry you can "cd" into an object, show and edit the methods, inspect and alter runtime variables, re-run a selection of lines of code, look up documentation, tab complete your commands and a whole lot more. All that, with really nice syntax highlighting too! I'm not quite sure of the equivalence to navigating a maze, but rest assured, the warlock would be finished in no time if you had pry in your backpack.</p>
