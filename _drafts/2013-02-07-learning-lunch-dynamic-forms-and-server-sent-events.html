<p>Keeping up with the quickly changing tech world is difficult. To help, every week we have a Learning Lunch where we pick out a video to watch as a group and discuss while we eat. These will often be videos of conference talks or from one of the many excellent Ruby on Rails screencasters.<br /><br />This week we fit in two episodes from the seminal <a href="http://railscasts.com/">RailsCasts.</a> One, on <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/403-dynamic-forms">dynamic forms,</a> we thought could be useful for a project we're currently working on and the other, on <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/401-actioncontroller-live">server-sent events,</a> exposed us to a new feature of the upcoming major version of Rails. Both were densely packed with information.<br /><br />It's a bit old now, but <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/332-refinery-cms-basics">here's one of our favourite RailsCasts episodes.</a>
