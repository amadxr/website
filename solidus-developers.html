  <p class="editable feature">
    <a href="https://solidus.io" target="_blank">Solidus</a> is an open source eCommerce platform that’s made for innovative, high-volume retailers.
  </p>
  <p class="editable">
     Built with Ruby on Rails, it is a “fork” of Spree Commerce 2.4 and shares many of Spree’s attributes: scalable, stable, responsive and customizable.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
  Solidus comes out-of-the-box with all the basics, so your development budget can focus on the unique features your store requires. 
  </blockquote>
<p class="editable">This applies as much to the front-end customer experience as to the back-end admin area, where we can tailor Solidus to match your internal workflows.</p>

  <h2 class="editable">Solidus vs Spree Commerce?</h2>
  <p class="editable">Solidus was created in August 2015, just prior to the announcement that&nbsp;<a href="https://spreecommerce.com">Spree Commerce</a>&nbsp;had been <a href="/blog/posts/spree-commerce-acquired-is-it-time-to-move-your-spree-store-to-solidus/">acquired by FirstData</a>. While the open source project remains, <a href="https://wombat.co">Wombat</a>, a proprietary product used by many Spree stores, has been shut down.</p>
  <h3 class="editable">Open Source Community</h3>
  <p class="editable">Well before the acquisition, it was obvious to the community that Spree Commerce had lost interest in the open source project and lost key people who had been driving it forward. &nbsp;Solidus has picked up where Spree left off, and is demonstrating the energy and enthusiasm that's a sign of a successful open source project. Solidus Conf 2016 is one important milestone: Join us in Toronto May 11-12.</p>
  <h3 class="editable">Our Advice</h3>
  <ol>
    <li class="editable">If you're starting fresh, go straight to Solidus. It's geared towards the needs of larger eCommerce stores and is supported by a vibrant community of developers.</li>
    <li class="editable">If you have an existing Spree Commerce store, you don't need to take any immediate action but consider <a href="/blog/posts/upgrading-your-store-from-spree-to-solidus/">migrating to Solidus</a>.</li>
