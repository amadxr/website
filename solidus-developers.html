  <h2>What is Solidus?</h2>
  <p class="editable">
    Solidus is an open source eCommerce platform that’s made for innovative, high volume retailers. Built with Ruby on Rails, it is a “fork” of Spree Commerce 2.4 and shares many of Spree’s attributes: scalable, stable, responsive and customizable.
  </p>
  <p class="editable">Solidus comes out-of-the-box with all the basics, so your development budget can focus on features that are unique to your store. This applies as much to the front-end customer experience as to the back-end admin area, where we can tailor Solidus to match your internal workflows.</p>
  <h2>Unprecedented Customization</h2>
  <p>
    Whether your goal is to deliver an experience that sets you apart in the minds of your customers, integrate with third party applications, or minimize administrative headaches, with Solidus we can build pretty much anything you can imagine. Why not talk to us about <em>your</em> vision?
