    <a href="https://solidus.io" target="_blank">Solidus</a> is an open source eCommerce platform that’s made for innovative, high-volume retailers.
  </p>
  <p class="editable">
     Built with Ruby on Rails, it is a “fork” of Spree Commerce 2.4 and shares many of Spree’s attributes: scalable, stable, responsive and customizable.

  <blockquote>
  Solidus comes out-of-the-box with all the basics, so your development budget can focus on the unique features your store requires.

    <br/><small>Solidus Admin Order Detail Screen</small>
  </p>


  <p class="editable">This applies as much to the front-end customer experience as to the back-end admin area, where we can tailor Solidus to match your internal workflows.</p>


  <p>
    Do you want your store to deliver an experience that sets you apart in the minds of your customers? Integrate with third party apps? Minimize admin headaches? With Solidus we can work with your design team or our design partners to build pretty much anything you can imagine.
