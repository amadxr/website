    <p class="feature editable">Manhattan Wardrobe Supply is the leading purveyor of hair, makeup and wardrobe care products for film, theater, and TV professionals. To better serve their New York City customers they were expanding their store in Chelsea, but online, things weren’t so rosy.</p>


    <p class="editable">When they first came to us, the MWS website was in serious trouble. Their previous developers would “solve one bug and three more would appear.” They’d spent 900 hours “stabilizing” the code base without adding a single new feature.</p>


    <p class="editable">RMWS asked us to assume ongoing maintenance of their site (running on Spree 1.3) and upgrade to a Spree 2.1. After diving-in we discovered, among other things:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Server errors</li>
<li>Slow page load times</li>
<li>No automated tests</li>
<li>Unnecessary customizations</li>
<li>Deployment restrictions</li>
<li>Hosting issues</li>

    </ul>
    <hr/>
    <p class="editable">We agreed on a monthly retainer and began the process of fixing these issues so we could eventually focus on improving the customer experience and raising the conversion rates.</p>
    <p class="editable">Over the past 18 months our work included a wide range of tasks to stabilize and update the existing code base and add new features that improve the customer experience and administrative functions.</p>

<ul>
<li>Shifting hosting to Heroku which provides a flexible and efficient solution
<li>Creating a staging site
<li>Adding a test suite to cover key site functions
<li>Deleting unused code
<ul><li>
 If it's redundant (<em>core Spree provides the same functionality</em>)</li>
 <li>If it's much more complicated than it needs to be</li>
<li>If it's not compatible with current Spree</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Updating to Spree 2.1</li>
<li>Creating landing pages for top level taxons like “makeup”</li>
<li>Adding batch product uploads</li>
<li>Improving site speed</li>
<li>Adding Algolia search to provide faster and more user-friendly search results
<li>Responsive design upgrade</li>
</ul>





    <p>While it doesn’t have the glamour of a Broadway musical, our work has resulted in significant improvements to the structure and function of the MWS site and sets the stage for future growth.</p>
