   <p class="editable">Select the options you&rsquo;re instantly and instinctively drawn to. The algorithm establishes your scent personality (in my case, the Goddess) and provides three matching fragrances. You can purchase 30ml bottles and/or Pinrose Petal Packs, their perfectly dosed single use fragrance sachets.&nbsp;</p>

  <h2 class="editable">The Challenge: Rapidly Changing Requirements</h2>
  <p class="editable">Initially a fixed set of questions was hard-coded. Scoring was written into the code. But it soon became apparent Pinrose needed flexibility to respond to growing business opportunities. </p>

  <p class="editable">
    No longer just on their own site, the quiz had to be embedded on other retail sites, and deployed to kiosks at over a hundred Nordstrom stores across the U.S. 
  </p>

  <h2 class="editable">The Solution: Editable and Responsive</h2>
  <p class="editable">Our recommendation was to make the quiz editable. This way they wouldn’t have to come back to us to adjust questions, images or scoring for each new application. </p>

  <blockquote>We made it fully-responsive so it would fit and work well on any third-party site or mobile device.</blockquote>

  <p class="editable">At the same time it was important not to over-engineer a solution. That&rsquo;s why we used Active Admin and integrated it with the Spree back-end. This approach is efficient; it avoids double entry and results in greater consistency.</p>

  <p class="editable">Product images and descriptions come from Spree and the administrator can edit which products match up with each persona.</p>

  <p class="editable">The in-store kiosks use the same web quiz but regularly download a copy of it. This makes is possible to remotely update the quiz without having to change anything on the iPads.</p>
  <hr />
  <h2 class="editable">The Impact</h2>
  <p class="editable">Over 100,000 people have taken this quiz and contributed to the recommendation algorithm. Thanks to our close collaboration, Pinrose has a successful marketing and sales tool that works in a wide variety of applications and responds to ever-changing requirements.</p>
