    <p class="feature">Pinrose is an unconventional fragrance company. Their mission is to use technology and science to help customers find and select perfume in a whole new way.</p>
    <p>Their popular scent finder quiz determines your “scent personality” based on the interconnection of your sensory preferences. The options are in the form of images, shapes, colors and sounds, which makes the quiz fun and unique.</p>
    <p>Select the options you’re instantly and instinctively drawn to. The algorithm establishes your scent personality (in my case, the Goddess) and provides three matching fragrances.</p>

  <h2>The Challenge: Rapidly Changing Requirements</h2>
  <p>Initially a fixed set of questions was hard-coded. Scoring was written into the code. But it soon became apparent Pinrose needed flexibility to respond to growing business opportunities. </p>

  <p>
    No longer just on their own site, the quiz had to be embedded on other retail sites, and deployed to kiosks at over a hundred Nordstrom stores across the U.S. 
  </p>
  <h2>The Solution: Editable and Responsive</h2>
  <p>Our recommendation was to make the quiz editable. This way they wouldn’t have to come back to us to adjust questions, images or scoring for each new application. </p>

  <p>We also made it fully-responsive so it would fit and work well on any third-party site or mobile device.</p>

  <p>At the same time it was important not to over-engineer a solution. That’s why we used ActiveAdmin and integrated it with the Spree back-end. This approach is efficient; it avoids double entry and results in greater consistency.</p>

  <p>Product images and descriptions come from Spree where the administrator can also edit which products match-up with each persona.
  </p>

  <p>The in-store kiosks use the same web quiz but regularly download a copy of it. This makes is possible to remotely update the quiz without having to change anything on the iPads.</p>

  <h2>The Impact</h2>
  <p>Thanks to our close collaboration, Pinrose has a successful sales tool that works in a wide variety of applications and responds to ever-changing requirements.</p>
