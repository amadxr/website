    <p class="subheader editable">Reducing Delivery Errors With Real-Time Address Validation</p>
    <p class="editable">3D Robotics is the smartest and most technologically advanced drone company in the world. The demand for their products is large and rapidly growing, but their Spree Commerce store was facing a serious problem: Incorrect and invalid shipping addresses. </p>

  <h2 class="editable">The Situation</h2>
  <p class="editable">Invalid shipping addresses delayed shipments from going out before they were manually corrected. 3D Robotics came to us to implement a solution to ensure address validation for all US and Canadian orders. </p>

  <p class="editable">
An undeliverable address, the wrong ZIP code, a typo in the street name, even a missing apartment number – these sorts of errors cost eCommerce retailers time and money. They delay deliveries, cause packages to be delivered to the wrong destination or returned as “undeliverable.”
  </p>

  <blockquote>Though the cause may be user error, the effect is a poor customer experience. Ultimately your business is responsible for timely and accurate deliveries.</blockquote>
  <p class="editable">
  This is why it’s so important to validate recipient addresses before you dispatch orders. By presenting address suggestions to your customers in the checkout process you make it easy for them to select an accurate, properly formatted address.

  <h2 class="editable">The Solution</h2>
  <p class="editable">The issue with address validation occurred in Netsuite, which uses the FedEx address validation APIs. So it made sense to use these same APIs in the Spree checkout process to ensure consistency.</p>
  <p class="editable">On the customer side, our goal was to minimize the number of steps required to complete the transaction. Our solution, a popup modal window which prompts customers to select the entered address or the validated one.</p>
  <p class="editable">The validated address is saved so there’s no need to display the modal window for any future orders. The stored address is already verified.</p>

  <h2 class="editable">The Result</h2>
  <blockquote>73% of customers on the 3D Robotics site opt to use address suggestions.</blockquote> 
  <p class="editable">Happier customers and lower costs. This dramatically reduces the number of manual adjustments to fix shipping addresses and ensures packages are dispatched as swiftly as possible.  </p>
