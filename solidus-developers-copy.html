      Ruby is a fluid, simple, and powerful open-source programming language.&nbsp;

  <p class="editable">
      Used for building entire sites, from backend to a great user interface, Ruby allows you to build clean and organized sites from the ground up. Ruby on Rails is a popular Ruby framework that makes it possible to build sleek websites quickly, using its large library of gems for highly-customized yet clean site structures.&nbsp;

  <blockquote class="editable">
      <p>Because Ruby on Rails is so organized and easily understandable, sites are easy to maintain and update, lowering cost and avoiding headaches.&nbsp;</p>

          Where Ruby on Rails shines:

     <p class="editable feature">
      Development is quick&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Rails is the fastest framework out there for taking a project from inception to completion. Excellent for MVPs and projects that need to be launched quickly, Rails is the best choice for developing sites and apps that need powerful back ends, done fast. Developers using RoR are able to build sites and apps around 40% faster than if they were using a different stack. </p>

            Easy implementation of complex logic
        </p>
        <p>
            Ruby on Rails makes it easy for you to incorporate complex business logic into your site or app. Excellent for APIs and eCommerce stores, Rails is a great option for quickly setting up a back end that will really work for you. With the addition of a front end framework, your application is ready to go in no time.

        <p class="editable feature">
            Gems reduce your time to market
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>"There's a gem for everything."</i>
            One of Ruby's best attributes is its huge library of gems, which have been developed over the years by members of the Ruby community. Gems allow for extremely useful – and simple – implementation of features between your application and external services, allowing you and your team to focus on the important stuff. Using gems to develop complex features simplifies your development process, enables you to better allocate time during development, and most importantly reduces your time to market.
