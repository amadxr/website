      Solidus vs Spree Commerce?
  </h2>
  <p class="editable">
      Solidus was created in August 2015, just prior to the announcement that&nbsp;<a href="https://spreecommerce.com">Spree Commerce</a>&nbsp;had been <a href="/blog/posts/spree-commerce-acquired-is-it-time-to-move-your-spree-store-to-solidus/">acquired by FirstData</a>. While the open source project remains, <a href="https://wombat.co">Wombat</a>, a proprietary product used by many Spree stores, has been shut down.
  </p>
  <h3 class="editable">
      Open Source Community
  </h3>
  <p class="editable">
      Well before the acquisition, it was obvious to the community that Spree Commerce had lost interest in the open source project when key people split.<br /><br />Solidus has picked up where Spree left off. It's demonstrating the energy and enthusiasm that's the sign of a successful open source project. The first "<a href="/blog/posts/solidusconf-2016/">Solidus Conf 2016</a>" is one important milestone.
