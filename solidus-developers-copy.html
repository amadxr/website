      Ruby is a fluid, simple, and powerful open-source programming language.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p class="editable">
      Used for building entire sites, from backend to a great user interface, Ruby allows you to build clean and organized sites from the ground up. Ruby on Rails is a popular Ruby framework that makes it possible to build sleek websites quickly, using its large library of gems for highly-customized yet clean site structures.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <blockquote class="editable">
      <p>Because Ruby on Rails is so organized and easily understandable, sites are easy to maintain and update, lowering cost and avoiding headaches.&nbsp;</p>
