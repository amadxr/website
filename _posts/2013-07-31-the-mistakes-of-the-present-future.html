<p>Watching <a href="https://twitter.com/worrydream" target="_blank">Bret Victor</a> speak on "<a href="http://worrydream.com/dbx/" target="_blank">The Future of Programming</a>" you might feel as if you have stepped out of time itself. I did, and the entire premise makes for an amusing and engaging talk. Presenting as if he was delivering the talk in 1973 rather than 2013, we are given a unique perspective on the programming practices we take for granted.</p>
<p>Describing developments in the theory and practice of programming that occurred in the decade leading up to 1973, Bret lays out an argument for this having been a unique period during which the concept of what programming is was fluid and ideas flowed freely, unhindered by dogma and past experiences. And perhaps - according to Bret - the path taken over the last 40 years has lead us astray from some of the better ideas of this decade.</p>
<p>The message is we need to be aware of different ways of thinking about programming, to welcome the same sort of creative freedom experienced during that period. Bret takes this so far as to say "The most dangerous thought you can have as a creative person is to think you know what you're doing."</p>
<p>Reflecting on this, I think of tools like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a>, <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a>, <a href="http://www.ruby-toolbox.com/" target="_blank">The Ruby Toolbox</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/" target="_blank">Twitter </a>that allow us to build upon the experiences of others, to learn from their mistakes and to grow a community of like-minded people. Perhaps though, if we tried first to solve a problem ourselves (individually or as a team) we might come up with a unique and creative solution that cannot be found elsewhere. Shared knowledge is a huge productive boon for us all, but it helps to keep in perspective that we don't have all the best answers - definitely not as individuals, and perhaps not even as a wider community. There is always room for new and different thinking.</p>
<p>Resolve will soon be closing a round of job interviews for a new position, and I'm very excited at the prospect of welcoming someone new to the team. Every team member here brings unique ideas and skills to the table and our work is the product of that. Adding to this mix will only strengthen the potential for what we can do in the future.</p>
