<p>Today we reached an important milestone for <a title="He's Small. He Bobbles. He's totally fearless." href="http://www.resolvedigital.com/work/ace-rider-game">Ace Rider</a>: 250,000 downloads. While this doesn't put Ace Rider in the ranks of the top games in the App Store, it does represent a significant achievement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Perhaps the best part is it has received over 1700 ratings with an average of 4.5 stars (out of 5 max). We're really proud of that. It tells us we've created a quality game people in over 100 nations around the world are playing and enjoying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that's inspiring us to forge ahead with our next challenge for Ace... stay tuned.</p>
