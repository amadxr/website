<p>Dropdowns: you use them every day but how can they be improved?</p>
<p><a href="http://bjk5.com/post/44698559168/breaking-down-amazons-mega-dropdown" target="_blank">Ben Kamens writes</a> about how Amazon uses a sprinkling of linear algebra to improve user experience when interacting with their mega dropdown.</p>

<h2>Before</h2>
<p>Moving the cursor from the '<em>Clothing, Shoes &amp; Jewelry</em>' menu item to '<em>Clothing</em>' in the submenu was previously quite tricky. Get it wrong and you'll find yourself opening a different drop down menu. Frustrating.</p>

<h2>After</h2>
<p>Amazon opens up the area that the cursor can move through by calculating a triangle between your mouse and the top and bottom of the open dropdown menu.</p>
<p>Now you can quickly and directly move your cursor to '<em>Clothing'</em>&nbsp;without frustration.</p>
