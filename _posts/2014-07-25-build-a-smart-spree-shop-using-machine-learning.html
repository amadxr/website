<p><span>Machine Learning (ML) can improve your customers’ experience, increase conversion rates, and&#160;</span>boost sales across channels. Although we focus on Spree Commerce, ML is relevant to any eCommerce site with at least a few hundred products and a bit of historical data.</p>

<h3>Learning from Amazon and Netflix</h3>
<p><span>What if you could understand your customer’s behavior based on past purchases and browsing patterns? What if your site could predict which products he or she is predisposed to buy?</span>
</p>
<blockquote>
<h3><span><span>Amazon.com and Netflix have been doing it for years. It’s called&#160;</span>
<span>“predictive analytics”&#160;</span>
<span>and is one of the many benefits machine learning can provide your eCommerce business.</span> </span>
</h3>
</blockquote>
<p><span><br />We know that if you show your customers the right content at the right time they’re more likely to take the action you want. For a shopping site that means click on the “add to cart” button and complete a purchase.</span>
</p>
<h3><span>Offering personalized recommendations based on unique behavior </span>
</h3>
<p><span>What <em>is</em> the right content? Th</span>e fact is every visitor has different goals, desires and motivations. ML algorithms continuously adapt to your customers' <em>behavior</em> to provide relevant, personalized product recommendations.&#160;This individualized approach improves the visitor experience. It results in up-selling and cross-selling opportunities that in turn lead to higher conversion rates and larger average order sizes.</p>

<p><span>You don’t have to be a Fortune 500 company to benefit from machine learning</span>
<span>.&#160;</span>ML is especially effective on sites with at least a few hundred products, where subtle differences between them may not be immediately obvious.&#160;The more history you have, the better. Ideally each product will have been purchased and/or rated at least ten times.&#160;</p>
<blockquote>
<h3><span>It comes down to this: can visitors easily discover products they want or do they need help finding new merchandise? </span>
</h3>
</blockquote>
<p><br />A recommendation engine sorts through all the options to deliver specific product suggestions for each customer based on their purchase history and preferences.</p>
