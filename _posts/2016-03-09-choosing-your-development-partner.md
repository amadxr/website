> “It was great meeting you and the team this morning. Rarely does a prospective client come along who seems like such a great fit. We’re confident this will be the start of a long and mutually beneficial working relationship between our two companies.”

I wrote that email back in November 2013. But it was not meant to be. Instead of signing our Master Service Agreement, the prospect replied:

> “We believe that your company will be the one, not only to make […] a great product, but will also have the expertise needed to ensure the code is efficient, security flaws are minimal, plus your knowledge of the US market will help us get a foothold there.”

**And then they hired another agency.** Why? They were up-front about their reason: Lower hourly rates.

Two-plus years later, they circled back with this update.

> “I wish we had gone with a company like you guys and I no doubt would not be in the mess I am in. [A…a] turned out to be spaghetti coders, so we moved to a local group called [E…l]. They have proved a disaster too and I now have a completely broken Xero integration. Losing customers daily. You live and you learn.”

> It is so difficult, when faced with a limited budget, to resist the allure of the low-priced option. But the risk is enormous.

Application development isn't a commodity. Experience matters. Expertise matters. **What seems like a bargain rarely turns out to be one in retrospect.** It isn’t the first time we’ve heard this sad story, and it’s not going to be the last.

So how do we help our clients minimize risk? By thinking strategically and communicating clearly. By defining an MVP and getting it launched so real people start using it sooner. By architecting a flexible solution we can build on. By delivering the greatest value we can within your project budget.

It’s not that there aren’t trade-offs. There always are. But compromising on code quality or hoping inexperienced developers will know how to solve tough technical problems doesn't often lead to happy endings.

If you're [looking for a development partner](/hire-us/), remember, you get what you pay for.
