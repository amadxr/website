title: Design Driven Development
---

<p>I recently read <a href="http://jesseddy.com/downloads/Design_Driven_Development.pdf" target="_blank">this excellent guide</a>&nbsp;"How to Foster Design-Driven Development in Your Company"&nbsp;by <a title="http://jesseddy.com/" href="http://jesseddy.com/">Jess Eddy</a>.</p>
<p>Design Driven Development (DDD) is a process whereby design and user experience drives the development of a product or software application.<!--more--> This leads to products that people enjoy using and want to tell others about.</p>
<p>Design is a very important and often overlooked aspect of software development. Programming functionality is only part of the solution. Products developed without proper consideration for the user experience are often bloated, ugly and difficult to use.</p>
<p>By creating a balanced team and putting design at the front and centre of software development, we can create applications that are beautiful, simple to use and ultimately more successful with customers.</p>
