<p>Responsive websites are all the rage. The ability to have one codebase that looks good on a computer, tablet, and smartphone is great. In fact, if your app is mainly content it's <a title="http://www.resolvedigital.com/about/blog/posts/heroku-partner-summit-and-waza-developer-event" href="heroku-partner-summit-and-waza-developer-event">better to have a responsive website than a native mobile app</a>. Using an existing framework to give you responsive out of the box can be really useful. The popular frameworks at the moment are <a title="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/" href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/" target="_blank">Twitter Bootstrap</a> and <a title="http://foundation.zurb.com/" href="http://foundation.zurb.com/" target="_blank">Zurb Foundation</a>. We've used both in various projects recently and the <a title="http://railscasts.com/episodes/417-foundation" href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/417-foundation" target="_blank">latest Railscast is on Foundation</a> so we watched it this week to see if there were bits we had missed.</p>
<p>One of the key features of Foundation 4 is that it's "mobile first" so it's easier to get it looking good on a smartphone. Because older browsers, including Internet Explorer 8, don't support responsiveness, "mobile first" does mean those browsers have that same mobile look on a bigger screen, but even <a title="http://www.ie6countdown.com/" href="http://www.ie6countdown.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft says it's time to upgrade</a>. Other impressions from using both Foundation and Bootstrap is that Foundation is easier to customize, which is important when you make <a title="Recent Work" href="http://www.resolvedigital.com/work">fancy looking websites</a>!</p>
<p>One of the great bits we did pick up from the video is the handy setup command for when you first add Foundation to a project. That'll make things a lot easier next time!</p>
