<p>Today I did a talk at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-Agile-Marketing/" target="_blank">San Francisco Agile Marketing</a> meet up. It was geared to a non-technical audience, and I hoped I help guide everyone to see how they can use machine learning with their online store. Machine Learning's not just for the big guys anymore. </p>
