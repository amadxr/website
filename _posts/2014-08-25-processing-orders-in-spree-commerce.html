<p><span>Like every eCommerce platform, <a href="http://www.resolvedigital.com/services/spree-commerce">Spree Commerce</a> is designed around assumptions about how a “typical” business processes orders. For many businesses this means little or no customization is required. But for others, particularly those with a brick-and-mortar legacy, customizations may be extensive. </span>
</p>
<p><span>The key is finding a balance between customizations (with their initial and long-term costs) and your ability to modify business processes to align with Spree’s model whenever possible. </span>

<p><span>Processing a credit card payment occurs in two steps: Authorize and capture. A payment is “authorized” when the credit card company confirms that the customer has sufficient funds available. It’s “captured” when the company actually transfers the funds. </span>
</p>
<p><span>Some eCommerce platforms do the capture step automatically when authorization is confirmed. Others require the storekeeper to check each authorized order and manually confirm that they’re ready to capture funds. Manual capture is the default. </span>
</p>
<h4><span>Should I use automatic or manual capture? </span>
</h4>
<p><span>The choice between automatic and manual capture depends on the nature of your business. If you deal in a high volume of orders that can be processed quickly and require little customer interaction, automatic capture can make your business very efficient. </span>
</p>
<p><span>If you often need to discuss orders with clients and adjust them, have long lead times before you can deliver, or need to manage stock outside of Spree, manual capture may be a better option. </span>

<h3><span>Processing an Order in Spree Commerce</span>
</h3>
<p><strong>1. Log in to Spree Admin </strong>
</p>
<p><span>You'll be taken to the orders page. A list of completed orders shows the most recently completed at the top. </span>
</p>
<p><strong>2. Select an order for payment </strong>
</p>
<p><span>Choose an order you need to process and click on the payment state (usually “Balance Due” or “Failed” – click right on the text). This will take you straight to a page listing the payments for that order. </span>
</p>
<p><strong>3. Capture the payment </strong>
</p>
<p><span>In the most common case, there’ll be an authorized payment ready to capture for the full amount of the order. Click on the checkmark button to capture the payment. </span>
</p>
<p><span>If the order has a failed payment you can edit the amount for each payment, or void it with the cross button. You can also create a new payment to record payments made in cash or credit cards outside Spree. </span>
</p>
<p><span>When the payments add up to the order total, you’re done. Click on “Back to Orders List” to return to the list of orders. The Payment State for your order has changed to “Paid.” </span>
</p>
<p><strong>4. Select an order for shipping</strong>

<div class="column">
<p><span>From the Orders list, click on the edit button. This will take you to the main order edit page. You can edit the order, add or remove products, apply discounts or extra charges (adjustments) and change shipping details. </span>
</p>
<p><strong>5. Ship </strong>
</p>
<p><span>You should see something like "[Code number] Ready Package From [Stock location]" and a SHIP button. Click on SHIP, and the order will be recorded as shipped. Click on “Back to Orders List” to return to the list of orders, and you’ll see the Shipment State for your order has changed to “Shipped.” </span>
