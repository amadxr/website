title: 'Setting design expectations: The mood board'
---

<p>About a year ago we began creating mood boards as the initial phase of our design process.</p>
<p>Before this, the first contact a client would have with design was when we presented the first round of page layouts.<!--more--> Discussions about the visual design would be diluted with unrelated questions about content or structure, and design solutions would often be compromised as a result.</p>
<p>The mood board gets everyone to agree on a visual design direction up front. Color palettes, font choices, basic layout and composition are locked in before any conversations about content and site architecture happen. And when the content conversations happen, everyone's already familiar with the look and feel of the site. No surprises.</p>
