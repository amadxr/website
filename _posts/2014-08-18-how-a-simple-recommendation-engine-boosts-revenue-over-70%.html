<p class="feature"><a href="/work/united-cellars">United Cellars</a> is an award-winning online wine retailer based in Australia. Their site is built on the <a href="http://www.spreecommerce.com" target="_blank">Spree Commerce</a> platform and supported by a well-trained telemarketing team. We proposed that a recommendation engine would improve the visitor experience and increase conversions, so we set up an A/B test to find out.
</p>

<p>The site currently has over:</p>
<ul>
<li>16,000 product views</li>
<li>60,000 orders</li>
<li>3,000 reviews</li>
</ul>
<p>
 With this valuable data we knew we could make quality product recommendations using Machine Learning algorithms provided by Prediction.IO - an open source prediction server. 
</p>
<h2>Getting started with a recommendation engine </h2>
<p> Because we have a long history with United we were already familiar with their business goals and customer behaviors. While everybody appreciates a good deal, price is <em>not</em> the main motivator for United’s best customers. They’re looking for wine they haven’t tried before that’s similar in style to vintages they’ve already purchased. 
</p>
<p>With this in mind, we set up a recommendation engine and A/B testing so we could compare the results to the baseline. We ran the test until we had statistically significant data. 
</p>
<p>We spent one week getting everything set up and running smoothly. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Prediction.IO server setup on Amazon Web Services</li>
<li>Push ratings, orders, and product views data to Prediction.IO server</li>
<li>Connect Prediction.IO server to Ruby Prediction.IO SDK running in the store</li>
<li>Retrieve recommended products</li>
<li>Display recommended products on the site</li>
<li>Set up A/B test
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Results of the A/B Test</h2>
<p>We ran the first test for 15 days. 50% of the traffic saw the Prediction.IO recommendations; 50% viewed the original site. The test demonstrated 
</p>
<ul>
<li>45% longer average session</li>
<li>22% increase in conversion rate</li>
<li>37% increase in average order value</li>
<li>71% increase in revenue</li>
</ul>
<p>The significant revenue increase is due to a combination of higher conversion rate and bigger average order value. The results were so compelling it was a no-brainer to start showing the recommendations to all visitors.</p>
<h2>More optimization opportunities</h2>
<p>In addition to on-site product recommendations, Prediction.IO unlocks many more possibilities. To build on their initial success, United is considering 
</p>
<ul>
<li>A tool for the telemarketing staff to offer customers personalized suggestions over the phone</li>
<li>Email marketing campaigns that send individualized recommendations to each recipient</li>
<li>Applying the recommendation engine to customize search results</li>
</ul>

<p>We hope this glimpse into the potential benefits of Machine Learning will inspire you to think about your site is a different way.
