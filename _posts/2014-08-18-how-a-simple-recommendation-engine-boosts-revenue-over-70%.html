<p><span>United Cellars is an award-winning online wine retailer based in Australia. Their site is built on the <a href="http://www.spreecommerce.com" target="_blank">Spree Commerce</a> platform and supported by a well-trained telemarketing team. <span>We proposed that a recommendation engine would improve the visitor experience and increase conversions, so we set up an A/B test to find out.</span>
</span>
</p>

<p>The site currently has over:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>16,000 product views </span>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>60,000 orders </span>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>3,000 reviews</span>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<span>With this valuable data we knew we could make quality product recommendations using Machine Learning algorithms provided by Prediction.IO - an open source prediction server. </span>

<h3><span><br />Getting started with a recommendation engine </span>
</h3>
<p><span>Because we have a long history with United we were already familiar with their business goals and customer behaviors. While everybody appreciates a good deal, price is <strong><em>not</em> </strong>the main motivator for United’s best customers. They’re looking for wine they haven’t tried before that’s similar </span>
<span>in style </span>
<span>to vintages they’ve already purchased. </span>
</p>
<p><span>With this in mind, we set up a recommendation engine and A/B testing so we could compare the results to the baseline. We ran the test until we had statistically significant data. </span>
</p>
<p><span>We spent one week getting everything set up and running smoothly. </span>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Prediction.IO server setup on Amazon Web Services </span>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Push ratings, orders, and product views data to Prediction.IO server </span>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Connect Prediction.IO server to Ruby Prediction.IO SDK running in the store </span>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Retrieve recommended products </span>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Display recommended products on the site </span>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Set up A/B test</span>
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3><span><br />Results of the A/B test </span>
</h3>
<p><span>We ran the first test for 15 days. 50% of the traffic saw the Prediction.IO recommendations; 50% viewed the original site. The test demonstrated </span>
</p>
<ul>
<li><span>45% longer average session</span>
</li>
<li><span>22% increase in conversion rate</span>
</li>
<li><span>37% increase in average order value</span>
</li>
<li>71% increase in revenue</li>
</ul>
<p><span>The significant revenue increase is due to a </span>
<span>combination </span>
<span>of higher conversion rate and bigger average order value. The results were so compelling it was a no-brainer to start showing the recommendations to </span>
<span>all </span>
<span>visitors.</span>
</p>

<h3><span>More optimization opportunities </span>
</h3>
<p><span>In addition to on-site product recommendations, Prediction.IO unlocks many more possibilities. To build on their initial success, United is considering </span>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>A tool for the telemarketing staff to offer customers personalized suggestions over the phone </span>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Email marketing campaigns that send individualized recommendations to each recipient </span>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Applying the recommendation engine to customize search results </span>
</p>
