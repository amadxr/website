Their site-specific projects inspire experimentation, imagination, and play.</p>

<p>With a dozen or more temporary projects at any given time, Gap Filler had difficulty maintaining and publishing an accurate list. Their printed “Gap Map” provided limited information and was quickly outdated.</p>
<p>We solved this problem with an easy to use iOS app that allows Gap Filler to create and promote up-to-the-minute listings and events. <a href="http://www.resolvedigital.com/work/gap-filler">Find out more</a> about the app or download the <a href="http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/380849/file-673774897-pdf/PDF_Folder/Press20Release20GapMapApp_2520March.pdf" target="_blank">press release</a> (PDF).</p>
