<p><img style="margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px; float: right;" title="Ruby Tapas" src="/system/images/W1siZiIsIjIwMTQvMTEvMjcvMDAvNDkvMzUvNzA2L3J1YnlfdGFwYXMucG5nIl1d/ruby-tapas.png" alt="Ruby Tapas" align="right" />Today was my last Learning Lunch before taking six months off while embarking on the great journey that is parenthood. I'll miss the discussions on what we've watched and the free lunch, but hopefully I'll be able to squeeze in some similar time at home.</p>

<p>We recently subscribed to <a href="http://www.rubytapas.com/" target="_blank">Ruby Tapas</a> by Avdi Grimm so this week was dedicated to taking advantage of that. Each video is a brief snippet of something interesting about Ruby so they can also be good when you don't have a whole lunch to sit down and watch things. There are even a few free episodes available to whet your appetite!</p>
<p>We started off with some dense helpings of super (#14, #16). One had a bit of bite with a gotcha about implicit passing of block arguments. From there we moved on to a sampling of fetch (#8, #12, #15) and its varied flavors as an assertion and providing a default and performance issues. We finished things off with a creamy dessert of bang bang (#94) to convert to booleans.</p>
<p>All the best to Resolve and our clients while I'm away. Keep enjoying the Tapas and Learning Lunch!</p>
