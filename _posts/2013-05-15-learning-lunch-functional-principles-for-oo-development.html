title: 'Learning Lunch: Functional Principles for OO Development'
---

<p>This week we watched an excellent talk entitled <a title="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/2382-rmw2013-functional-principles-for-oo-development" href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/2382-rmw2013-functional-principles-for-oo-development" target="_blank">Functional Principles for OO Development</a>&#160;from this year's Ruby Midwest conference. Presented by the passionate and amusing <a title="http://twitter.com/jessitron" href="http://twitter.com/jessitron" target="_blank">Jessica Kerr</a>, this talk took us to places not normally found in the Ruby world.&#160;</p>

<p>Jessica's background as a Java OO (Object Oriented) programmer and her current work with Scala, a <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional programming</a> language, has helped her see the advantages of being able to mix these paradigms for both code clarity and performance reasons. Ruby is a language that (given some caveats) allows you to program in both a functional and OO manner, and Jessica gives some interesting examples of how this can be achieved.</p>
<p>Jessica also wrote a <a title="http://blog.jessitron.com/2013/04/dataflow-in-ruby.html" href="http://blog.jessitron.com/2013/04/dataflow-in-ruby.html">blog post</a> about her functional optimization of some example code in the <a title="http://pragprog.com/book/ruby/programming-ruby" href="http://pragprog.com/book/ruby/programming-ruby">Pickaxe</a> (a popular Ruby textbook) which complements the talk.</p>
<p>Aside from the excellent content of her talk, it is always good to see such a confident and engaging speaker at these events.</p>
