<p dir="ltr"><span>A storytelling iPad app for kids, Imagistory makes it fun to </span>
<span>create and record their own stories. Using their imagination to describe what’s happening in the beautifully illustrated books, they can make-up, listen to, and share their own unique stories.</span>

</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Our job was to turn a rough prototype into a minimum viable product (MVP). When the MVP was well-received, we came back and developed a fully-featured product with multiple books. We worked closely with the business owner Nick Barrett and visual designer Dylan Luc Du Plessis to shape the overall user experience.</span>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">The concept is simple. Kids look at the wordless picture books, think about what they see and record the stories they imagine. They can pause the recordings, save them, and play them back. They hear their own stories, in their own voices.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The primary goal was to make the app simple enough for young kids to use, but offer additional features for parents. Hidden behind the “Parental Gate,” the app includes instructions and ideas to develop creativity and language skills.</span>

<span><br class="kix-line-break" /></span>
</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Built specifically for the iPad, one important aspect to the app was creating videos from recordings that can be shared. This involved converting a series of images and audio recordings into a composed video. We used AV Foundation, a media framework for iOS, and wrote custom code that composed images and video intro, outro and crossfade transitions.</span>

</a><span> and includes two picture books. Additional books are available through in-app purchases. Next steps include a version for schools and libraries using Apple’s Volume Licensing Program. This will make it easy for administrators to purchase bulk licenses, paying once and distributing to teachers and students.</span>
