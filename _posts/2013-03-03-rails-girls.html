<p><a title="http://railsgirls.com/" href="http://railsgirls.com/" target="_blank">Rails Girls</a>&nbsp;is a non-profit volunteer community with the aim to introduce women to technology and programming through learning Ruby on Rails. Originally started in Finland, it is now a global organisation. &nbsp;</p>

<p>A local programmer Rebekah Wilson organised the <a title="http://railsgirls.com/christchurch" href="http://railsgirls.com/christchurch" target="_blank">Christchurch Rails Girls event</a>&nbsp;which was held last weekend in a local school. There were 24 women ranging in age from 9 to 40+ and 10 coaches from the local Ruby community. Two of us from Resolve Digital came along to help out. It is fascinating how challenging it is to convey programming concepts. &nbsp;Just what is a variable anyway?! ;-)</p>
<p>By the end of the weekend there were 24 new Heroku sites and a number of new recruits to the Ruby on Rails community. There will be follow up events to give the new programmers all the support and encouragement we can.</p>
