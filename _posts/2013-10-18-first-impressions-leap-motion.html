title: 'First impressions: Leap Motion'
---

<p>Before I left San Francisco to visit our office in Christchurch, I connected with a friend at <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/" target="_blank">Leap Motion</a> to grab a couple of devices to play with. Not everyone at Resolve knew what they were at first but soon after we all had a play it was an experience that will not be forgotten.</p>

<h3>What is a Leap Motion?</h3>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_Motion" target="_blank">According to Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>a computer hardware sensor device that supports hand and finger motions as input, but requiring no hand contact or touching.</blockquote>

<p>A bit about the technology it uses to achieve this:</p>
<blockquote>a small USB peripheral device which is designed to be placed on a physical desktop, facing upward. Using two monochromatic IR cameras and three infrared LEDs.</blockquote>
<h3>First We Played</h3>
<p>The Leap Motion is a device you just have to try out for yourself. We sat down and tried some of the applications available in the <a title="https://airspace.leapmotion.com" href="https://airspace.leapmotion.com" target="_blank">Air Space Store</a>. Very quickly you get a real sense of what works well and what doesn't.</p>

<p><a href="https://airspace.leapmotion.com/apps/cyber-science-motion/osx" target="_blank">Cyber Science</a> and&#160;<a href="https://airspace.leapmotion.com/apps/molecules/osx" target="_blank">Molecules</a> were two free apps we tried that had really solid controls.</p>
<h3>Google Earth</h3>
<p>Next we gave <a href="https://airspace.leapmotion.com/links/google-earth" target="_blank">Google Earth</a> a go.</p>
<p>It's worth taking a moment to appreciate just how much control is needed to interact with an application like Google Earth. You can do all these things with a single hand:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zoom (in and out)</li>
<li>Tilt (up and down)</li>
<li>Pan (all directions)</li>
</ul>
<p>At first our ability to control Google Earth looked about as good as someone who'd had a few too many drinks. But then with a few minutes of playing around we started to get the hang of it. We made a challenge to go from completely zoomed out to our house and we all managed to do so surprisingly quickly.</p>

<p>After enough playing something magical happened. Your brain stops thinking about controls and you're intuitively flying around earth in a natural way. This is when the Leap Motion goes from cool to absolutely awesome.</p>
<h3>Some Issues</h3>
<p>Now it's not <em>all</em> awesome though. There's a couple of niggles I have with it:</p>
<ul>
<li>It only senses from one side (normally the bottom). If you start with your hands apart and move them closer until they overlap the Leap Motion thinks one hand is gone because that's all it can now see. This is an obvious limitation but perhaps could be resolved in a laptop situation where you have one sensor on the top of the screen and one from the bottom near the trackpad.</li>
<li>Each app requires the controls to be learnt fresh. Confusingly some apps do different things for the same sort of movement. I think Leap Motion should publish developer guidelines to cover common interactions and document one best case gesture for each.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stay tuned as next up we'll be writing about our experience of developing an application for Leap Motion.</p>
