<p class="feature editable">PCI compliance is a security standard designed to keep credit card information safe and prevent fraud. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) applies to companies of any size that accept credit card payments.</p>

<p class="editable">The problem is compliance can be difficult to achieve and hard to maintain. If your site doesn&rsquo;t meet the current standard you can be subject to large fines or denied the ability to process credit card payments.</p>

<blockquote>
For most online only merchants their choice of payment gateway is the single
biggest factor determining the burden of PCI compliance on their
business and informed selection can mitigate many if not all of these
concerns.</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 class="editable">The PCI Compliance Burden</h2>
<p class="editable">PCI DSS has a large scope: From websites to servers to the LANs and computers that come in contact with cardholder data. It's extremely specific and onerous.</p>

<h3 class="editable">Self-Assessment Questionnaire</h3>
<p class="editable">In attempting to achieve compliance you will need to complete a Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ). There are different types ranging from A to DD (the most stringent).</p>
<p class="editable">You must complete and submit your questionnaire to your merchant bank annually. If you're not compliant you'll be required to develop and submit a plan to resolve any issues, along with time frames.</p>
<h3 class="editable">Application and Network Security Scan</h3>
<p class="editable">A regular security scan of your store and network will be run. This essentially runs a set of heuristics/rules that scan for red flags. If there are too many, or any that are too severe, action must be taken to move back into compliance. This must be done by an authorized scanning vendor and the report or certificate of compliance submitted to your merchant bank on a regular basis.</p>
<h3 class="editable">Data Center Compliance</h3>
<p class="editable">You must also make sure that the data center your site is hosted with is compliant. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/pci-dss-level-1-faqs/">Amazon AWS</a> is extremely good in this regard.</p>

<h2 class="editable">A Path To PCI Avoidance</h2>

<blockquote>When people ask us about becoming PCI compliant, we prefer to flip the question. What can we do about PCI avoidance?</blockquote>

<p class="editable">Our clients are often able to completely avoid PCI compliance. So you’re probably wondering how can you sidestep this burden? Before I tell you, let’s first understand how PCI compliance came about from a practical perspective.</p>

<p class="editable">Let’s consider five alternatives for implementing payments on your store.</p>

<h3 class="editable">Solution 1: The Simplest Thing Possible</h3>

<p class="editable"><strong>[image 1 here]</strong></p>

<p class="editable">In the early days of eCommerce you see solutions like this. From the developer standpoint it’s the easiest solution you could implement with traditional payment providers.</p>

<p class="editable">Credit details are stored in your database like everything else. You contact the payment provider with those details and get a response. You don’t bother setting up HTTPS to encrypt the transmission from the browser to your server.</p>

<p class="editable">This solution is highly unsecure. Someone could intercept this information when it is transmitted or steal all the unencrypted credit card information stored in the database.</p>

<p class="editable">It’s worth noting though that this flow is good in terms of developer time spent. It’s also good for the user because they stay on your site throughout the process.</p>

<h3 class="editable">Solution 2: Bank Hosted Payment Page</h3>

<p class="editable"><strong>[image 2 here]</strong></p>

<p class="editable">This solution came about when payment providers saw how bad Solution A was. It allows payment providers to have full control and confidence that credit card data is secure all along the way.</p>

<p class="editable">While this option is more secure, it forces your customers down a strange path. One moment they’re on your site, the next they’re on another site (that doesn’t look like the page they came from) and they’re asked to enter payment information. This disconnect will negatively impact your conversion rate.</p>

<p class="editable">Some payment providers try to reduce this confusion by allowing the store owner to customize the header and footer of the payment page to make it feel as much as possible like you’re still on the original store website.</p>

<h3 class="editable">Solution 3: Homegrown Encryption</h3>

<p class="editable"><strong>[image 3 here]</strong></p>

<p class="editable">With this solution credit card data is encrypted during every step of transmission and storage. It isn’t a bad option, but everyone will implement it differently.</p>

<p class="editable">There's another problem. While everything is encrypted along the way, ideal security is much broader. Questions will arise like: Who has access to the server? How up to date is your software? Have you patched your servers with the latest fixes on the encryption protocols?</p>

<p class="editable">There’s a lot to be concerned about with this DIY solution. You’ll always be questioning if you’ve set up the encryption perfectly.</p>

<h3 class="editable">Solution 4: PCI Compliance</h3>

<p class="editable">PCI compliance looks just like Solution 3 except you'll be subject to the burden of PCI compliance as discussed earlier.</p>

<h3 class="editable">Solution 5: PCI Avoidance (recommended)</h3>

<p class="editable"><strong>[image 5 here]</strong></p>

<p class="editable">Finally we’re at PCI avoidance. The payment provider is PCI compliant but you do not need to be. Why is that? Because no credit card data is transmitted or stored with you. Here’s how it works.</p>

<p class="editable">The customer’s credit card is sent directly to the payment provider. A token, (not the actual credit card data) is then stored in your database.</p>

<p class="editable">While being secure and avoiding PCI compliance, we’ve also given the customer a better user experience by staying on your site at all times.</p>

<h2 class="editable">Conclusion</h2>

<p class="editable">Use a payment provider that allows you to offer both a great user experience and avoid the need for PCI compliance.</p>

<p class="editable">If your store is running on Spree Commerce or Solidus, you’ll be using the <a href="http://activemerchant.org">Active Merchant</a> library to process payments. <strong>Payment processes such as <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a> and <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com">Braintree</a> offer modern payment solutions that allow you to avoid PCI compliance and are compatable with Active Merchant.</strong></p>

<p class="editable">Avoiding the need for PCI compliance means you can rest easy knowing your site is secure, your customers are happy, and you&rsquo;ve warded off the pain and expense of staying compliant.</p>
