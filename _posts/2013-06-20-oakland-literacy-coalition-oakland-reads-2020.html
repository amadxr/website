<p>They presented us with an interesting challenge: create two sites which have a similar look and feel but address the needs of very different audiences.</p>
<p>The Coalition website allows organizations to sign up to be part of a network of literacy service providers and advocates. Members can login to maintain their own directory listing and learn about upcoming meetings and events.</p>

<p>We were pretty happy about this email from our client shortly after the sites launched:</p>
<p><em>Here's a comment I received from one of the literacy coalition members: "Nice! Congrats to everybody who helped develop these immensely appealing and informative websites. Well done!"</em></p>
<p><em>It's been great working with the Resolve team and we are all so pleased with the outcome. Thank you all!</em></p>
