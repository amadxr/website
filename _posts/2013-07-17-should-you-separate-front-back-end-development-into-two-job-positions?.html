<p>It's an interesting question to ponder. There's been a <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/107503/is-it-common-to-separate-back-end-and-front-end-into-two-positions-on-web-develo" target="_blank">few</a> <a href="http://www.trottercashion.com/2010/07/07/startups-dont-hire-frontend-or-backend-webdevs.html" target="_blank">discussions</a> on this topic and the general answer is "<em>it depends.</em>" At Resolve, we've never advertised "back-end" or "front-end" specific development jobs. Why is this? By design.</p>

<h3>Hire hackers not specialized developers</h3>
<p>Developers generally have a stronger side but if you define a side in their job title, you're not encouraging them to learn what they don't know. You want developers that are well rounded and can ideally work on any aspect of a project. How will they learn if you haven't kept things open and allowed them to reach this sweet spot?</p>
<h3>Teamwork</h3>
<p>Let's say Sam has to do some back-end work, but he knows he's stronger on the front-end. If you've setup the right environment for your team, Sam will go pair with Jill who's really awesome on the back-end. Now Sam is learning heaps and Jill is feeling great for teaching Sam. This is a huge teamwork win.</p>
<h3>Less Excuses</h3>
<blockquote>"I don't fix front-end issues, you'll need to talk to Sam" - Jill.</blockquote>
<p>Jill now has an excuse not to bother to learn how to solve the front-end issues because it's not her job.</p>
<p>You don't want excuses, you want your developers to get good at finding solutions and working with other team members even if an issue isn't occurring in their strong area.</p>
<h3>Better Balance</h3>
<blockquote>"We can't move forward because we're waiting on the front-end developer and he/she is busy."</blockquote>
<blockquote>"We've got so much back-end work to do, but the front end team is twiddling their thumbs."</blockquote>
<p>If you hire hackers you won't have to think about balancing front and back-end development work because it's everyone's responsibility.</p>
<h3>Self Organizing Teams</h3>
<p>If you've hired the right team, they will divide responsibilities themselves. Maybe Jill has been doing back-end work for ages but is really keen on learning something new. We encourage our developers to speak up about their interests and divide responsibilities to maximize learning and job satisfaction.</p>
