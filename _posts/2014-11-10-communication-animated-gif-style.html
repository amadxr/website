<p>Good project management calls for clear communication. I find using just words inefficient&nbsp;and often misleading. We all know interpretation varies from one person to another.&nbsp;So what’s the most effective way to share the changes you’ve made with the development team?</p>

<p>Adding a screenshot helps but seeing the <em>interaction</em> conveys much more. This is where animated GIFs come in. They're not known to be the highest quality or have the best compression but they've been around for long enough to have gained deep support just about everywhere.</p>
<p>But how can you make an animated GIF quickly? Enter <a href="http://recordit.co" target="_blank">Recordit</a> - a beautifully focused and simple tool for taking a short screencast of anything on your screen. Once your recording is finished, it's uploaded to the cloud ready for sharing in seconds.</p>
<p>Here's an animated GIF of me using Recordit to make an animated GIF.</p>
<p><img src="/system/images/W1siZiIsIjIwMTQvMTEvMjcvMDAvNDkvMjYvODQ5L1NjcmVlbl9SZWNvcmRpbmdfMjAxNF8xMV8wN19hdF8wNS4xNF9wbS5naWYiXV0/Screen_Recording_2014-11-07_at_05.14_pm.gif" alt="Screen_Recording_2014-11-07_at_05.14_pm"></p>
<p>As you can see it all happens quickly. Press the record icon; draw the size of the area to record; hit record; hit stop when you're done. Click the "GIF" button on the notification at the end to go to the share page.</p>
<p>I find myself using it to convey changes on a Github Pull Request so another developer can see exactly what changes to expect during code review. I also use it when I find a cool interaction on a web page I want to share with the team.</p>
<p>Here's an example I shared last week:</p>

<p>Recordit is not the only tool that makes this task easy. Checkout <a href="https://www.getcloudapp.com" target="_blank">CloudApp</a> too. Happy Recording.</p>
