<p>Yesterday we did a demo of <a title="He's Small. He Bobbles. He's totally fearless." href="http://www.resolvedigital.com/work/ace-rider-game">Ace Rider</a> at the <a title="http://www.svios.org/" href="http://www.svios.org/">iOS Developers &amp; Entrepreneurs</a> mixer, hosted at Apps World at the Moscone Center.</p>
