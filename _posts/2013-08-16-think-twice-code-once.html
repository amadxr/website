title: Think Twice Code Once
---

<p>For this week's learning lunch we watched <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiox36WH_lc" target="_blank">Think Twice Code Once by Bill Chapman</a>. The central message is that software development is generally a thinking occupation, and we should take time to design the solution before attacking the coding part.</p>

<p>Thinking and doing need to be approached in different ways to be most effective. &#160;In&#160;<a href="http://pragprog.com/book/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning" target="_blank">Pragmatic Thinking and Learning</a>, Andy Hunt explains (at a high level) the difference between left brain and right brain modes. &#160;As a <em>really simplistic </em>summary - left brain is great for logical step-by-step thinking (coding) and right brain is good for combining lots of information together and coming up with an overall solution. &#160;Right brain activity is generally more powerful and asynchronous. &#160;How often have you been thinking about a problem, given up and done something else, and you come back and the answer is there? &#160;More than once? &#160;I thought so.</p>
<p>So the trick is, how do we engage with this more powerful right brain activity. &#160;Well, before I attempt to answer that question, let me try and convince you that smart people do this (it's not just a wacky idea). &#160;Recently I went to a talk on <a href="https://vimeo.com/70985827" target="_blank">Einstein's Universe</a>&#160;given by the Royal Society of New Zealand. &#160;It was an excellent lecture - half physics, half music. &#160;One of the things that really struck me was that Einstein would often be thinking about a hard problem, and then go off and play his violin. &#160;Every so often he would come out, make some notes, go back and continue playing. &#160;He wasn't exactly consciously thinking about the problem - but his brain was off solving things. &#160;</p>
<p>Another person using a different technique to tap into right brain mode was <a href="http://fireballimagery.wordpress.com/2011/09/01/the-naps-of-thomas-edison/" target="_blank">Edison</a>. &#160;He used to fall asleep thinking about a problem with a ball-bearing in each hand. &#160;When he fell asleep, he'd drop the balls into a metal tray, they'd make a noise and he'd wake up. &#160;Then he'd write down what he was thinking. &#160;So, if you want to be in the company of Edison and Einstein here are five suggestions.</p>
<h3>1) Go for a walk</h3>
<p>Next time you're struggling with a hard problem try loading seven +/- two points (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two" target="_blank">Millers Law</a>) into your brain and go for a walk. &#160;Give your brain time to come with a solution offline.</p>
<h3>2) Exercise and brain exercise</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.royalsociety.org.nz/events/annual/distinguished-speaker/2010-series/" target="_blank">Another RSNZ talk</a>&#160;I went to showed how the brain can physically change and grow. &#160;The more you use it the more you get. &#160;This also goes for ideas. &#160;Keep a little notebook with you at all times so you can jot down those elusive thoughts as they come and go.</p>
<h3>3) Engage more of the brain</h3>
<p>Try to engage more of the brain while you're thinking on a problem. For example, juggling, spinning a pen, doodling etc. can all help engage the right brain mode.</p>
<h3>4) Pair programming</h3>
<p>One of the many advantages of pair programming is that often one of the pair is engaged in left brain activity (actually coding) while the other can be thinking more of overall design and how the particular feature works in the context of the whole project (right brain).</p>
<h3>5) Active learning</h3>
<p>Not strictly about thinking and coding, but one of the suggestions from Andy Hunt's book; create your own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_wiki">personal wiki</a>. So instead of simply Googling the solution to a problem and using it, dump it in your wiki. Simply writing will help cement it in your brain. Or use a project like&#160;<a title=" http://mnemosyne-proj.org/" href=" http://mnemosyne-proj.org/" target="_blank">mnemosyne project</a>&#160;to remind you of the things you're trying to learn.</p>
<p>So yes, an excellent talk, here's to always having more to learn!</p>
