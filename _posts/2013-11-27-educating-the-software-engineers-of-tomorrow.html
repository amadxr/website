title: Educating the software engineers of tomorrow

<p>Recently we watched an&#160; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Hc7DBihkh4" target="_blank">interesting talk</a> by&#160; <a href="https://twitter.com/zachbruggeman" target="_blank">Zach Bruggeman</a>, a very bright and well spoken high school student.</p>

<p>The goal of this talk was to promote JavaScript as a first language for students learning to program, but Zach also went on to expound his opinions about the education system, particularly about the lack of options when it comes to specialising in an area of interest.</p>
<p>Given that Zach was voicing his own opinions (as an obviously above average student), I felt that he raised some interesting points. High School has traditionally been where students learn broader subjects to give them an overall knowledge base for University, where they will become specialists in their chosen field.</p>
<p>Providing the opportunities to specialise at High School could have some benefits for students like Zach, who perhaps already have varied interests and defined goals. However, this approach could prevent students from receiving a broader education which can show them other areas that they could be interested in.</p>
<p>In my opinion, creating an environment at High School where young people are narrowly focussed into specialist paths could have damaging effects on those people, as well as the industries they choose to move into.</p>
<p>The sort of people that I find the most inspiring and interesting to work with, are those that are polyglots in their own right, having interests and vast knowledge outside of their chosen career.</p>
<p>As far as the main thrust of the talk went, I found the idea of JavaScript as a first language very interesting. The accessibility of JavaScript is unbeatable really, as anyone who has a computer with a browser will have a developer console and JavaScript built in. Other languages generally have some form of setup/installation procedure, so that ease of access is definitely a bonus for people new to programming.</p>
<p>The excitement factor is definitely easily attainable, especially to a generation that is very used to the web, and interact with it on a daily basis. They can create and modify elements on a webpage with minimal training, which I imagine would be an attractive and visual way to begin with.</p>
<p>Being a scripting language, the syntax is reasonably easy to grasp, and new users can learn a lot of the core programming paradigms without having to delve into the intricacies of the language until much later on.</p>
<p>I hope that more teaching institutions start to use scripting languages such as JavaScript, Ruby, and Python as learning languages, as their syntax and usage is definitely a lot easier for new users to grasp than some of the more traditional strongly typed languages like Java or C++ that are often used.</p>
<p>Zach Bruggeman seems like a young man who will go far, and it was very good to see such a passionate guy ready to speak in front the large audience he had at CascadiaJS. Good luck for your future Zach!</p>
