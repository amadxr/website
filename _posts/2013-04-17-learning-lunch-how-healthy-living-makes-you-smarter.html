<p>Programmer health has been getting a lot of focus within the community in the last few years. Most Ruby conferences now have a 5k run as one of their events. Big Ruby Conf in Dallas at the beginning of March had two talks about health that are viewable on Confreaks. This week we watched <a href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/2304-bigruby2013-build-a-bigger-brain-how-healthy-living-makes-you-smarter" target="_blank">Build a Bigger Brain: How Healthy Living Makes You Smarter.</a>
</p>

<p>Talks like this can be a bit scary as they foretell health problems and worse, but this one provides a lot of ideas for how to prevent these dangers. The talk also discusses the improvements exercise can have on our brains and job performance so it's beneficial to the bottom line as well as waistline. The presenter has done his homework. In fact, he's <a href="http://healthyprog.com/">written the book on the subject</a>.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter if you're a programmer, if you sit at a desk all day you should watch this video. There's also a companion iPhone app to help you apply what it teaches. We're all interested in being healthy and avoiding premature death, so we'll be trying out some of the ideas from the video and seeing how they fit into our lives and work day.</p>
<p>Here's to your health!</p>
