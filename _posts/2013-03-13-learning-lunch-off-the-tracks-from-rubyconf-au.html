Fortunately videos of all the talks are <a title="http://vimeo.com/channels/486849" href="http://vimeo.com/channels/486849" target="_blank">available on Vimeo</a>.  This week we watched Nick Sutterer's <a title="http://vimeo.com/61255731" href="http://vimeo.com/61255731">Off the Tracks: Challenging the Rails Mindset</a> which discusses various libraries and methods that can be used to override Rails defaults and improve the architecture of a project.</p>

<p>The talk is given by a German in Australia, so it was guaranteed, and possibly even required, to involve beer, but only on the slides.  We thought the introduction didn't really relate to the bulk of the talk and involved a lot of photos and references that you had to be at the conference to appreciate, so if you just want the meaty bits start at 7:37.  Also, the video description is wrong because it doesn't match the four topics he covers.</p>
<p>The first method he talks about is separating your domain models from your persistence layer using Plain Old Ruby Objects and optionally DataMapper 2.  It was nice to see examples, with cowboys and beer nonetheless, of a concept that's been talked about for a while now.</p>
<p>The second idea was view inheritance or encapsulation of views using the cells gem.  This was mostly new to us and quite interesting.  It showed tangible improvements even with his simplistic examples!</p>
<p>Possibly the most conceptually interesting idea was breaking controllers up into multiple classes, each obeying the Single Responsibility Principle, using the objectify gem.  The example was unfortunately minimal because he wasn't too familiar with the gem.</p>
<p>The fourth idea was for APIs using the roar or representer gems to produce them from good object oriented documents.  As the video description says, this could be good for RESTful APIs, though he doesn't really discuss that bit.</p>
<p>We're always on the lookout for ideas that lead to better code design and this video delivered!  The topics discussed could be especially useful on larger projects. Definitely worth watching.</p>
