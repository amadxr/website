<p><a href="http://www.resolvedigital.com/play/ace-rider" target="_blank">Ace Rider</a>&nbsp;is&nbsp;a motorcycle game for iOS that we released two years ago. The game's character - Ace - remained anonymous for that game, concealed within his helmet like a bobble-headed <a href="http://www.topgear.com/uk/stig" target="_blank">Stig</a>. His anonymity made him more relatable.<!--more--></p>
<p>With our new game,&nbsp;<a title="Pilots Wanted!" href="http://www.resolvedigital.com/play/ace-flyer" target="_blank">Ace Flyer</a>, we realized Ace had to reveal his identity. So who is Ace? What does he look like? Turns out he's a dashing young chap with a taste for speed and adventure.</p>
<p><strong>Early concepts</strong></p>

<p>Flying goggles were a requirement. No self respecting air racer would take to the skies without them. They also allow Ace to retain a degree of anonymity.</p>
<p>Early on we were thinking he'd have a mop of tousled hair that would be blown back in the wind during a race:</p>

<p>...but the character is so small in the game play view that his hair wouldn't be clearly visible. Instead, Ace wears a classic leather flying helmet. He'll also be able to upgrade his headgear to some pretty awesome alternatives.</p>

<p>And here he is - drum roll please!</p>
