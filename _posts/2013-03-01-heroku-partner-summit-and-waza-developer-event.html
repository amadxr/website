title: Heroku Partner Summit and Waza Developer Event
---

<p><span style="background-color: transparent;">On Wednesday I attended the Heroku Partner Summit. It was a fairly&#160;small&#160;event held at Heavy Bit. The event was invite only and was for two types of people:&#160;</span>
<span style="background-color: transparent;">Add-on providers and s</span>
<span style="background-color: transparent;">ervice integrators.</span>
</p>
<p>Resolve sits in the second category. You hire us to build your project and deploy it on Heroku's platform.</p>
<p>Heroku's COO&#160;Oren Teich spoke a little bit about where Heroku is headed and the <a title="https://partners.heroku.com/" href="https://partners.heroku.com/">Partner Directory</a> was also brought up. The idea of the partner directory is to allow people who have projects to find a developer to build them.</p>
<h3>Waza Developer Event</h3>
<p>On Thursday the Waza developer event kicked off in usual Waza style with a traditional&#160;Japanese style drumming&#160;performance&#160;and some live&#160;calligraphy&#160;that eventually became the banner for the conference. You can see it being created on stage below:</p>

<p>This year Waza was more than 3 times larger than last year with over 1,000 developers attending. There was a great relaxed atmosphere and a range of high quality talks.</p>
<p>We got a chance to talk to other fine developers and what they're up to as well as hang out and hack on projects. I also had a chance to congratulate&#160;Yukihiro Matsumoto (the creator of the Ruby programming language) in person on the release of Ruby 2.0.</p>
<p>One talk I enjoyed was "<em>Mobile is Not Different"</em> by Mattt Thompson. He touched on two points that really&#160;resonated&#160;with me:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Mobile apps are cloud apps</strong> - the idea that probably 90% or more of the apps on your phone are totally useless without an internet connection. When you're building an app you most likely need to think about building an app in the cloud to provide information to the app.</li>
<li><strong>Web vs Native</strong> - If the main thing about your app is content, make a responsive website. If the main part of your app is about interaction, make a native app.</li>
</ol>

<p>We'll definitely be back next year. Thanks for a great day Heroku.</p>
