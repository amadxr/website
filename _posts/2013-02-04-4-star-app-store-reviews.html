title: 4 star App Store reviews
---

<p>Reviews on your app can be a mixed bag. How do you find useful feedback from thousands of reviews? Especially when so many reviews are often just one or two words to pass Apple's review validation requirements.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>With our app <a href="http://www.resolvedigital.com/work/ace-rider-game">Ace Rider</a>, I find 4 star reviews to be the most telling. 4 star reviews are often players who understand and respect our app but there are one or two things which bother them so they hold a star back from you. Best of all, they tell you why.</p>
<p>Here's a sample of Ace Rider's 4 star reviews:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>★★★★☆ Good game needs better controls<br>This game is good but the controls are a little bit hard to use. Improve the controls and it will b a 5 star game.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>★★★★☆ Good game. If u added a brake it be even better<br>I get that it makes it more difficult without a brake but at the same time less fun also</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>★★★★☆ Great fun.<br>Easy, awesome. Any more levels on the horizon?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>★★★★☆ Fun<br>Good game but you should be able to tilt in both directions</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>★★★★☆ Woohoo<br>Super fun but it would be more fun if it had brakes and if leaning your device would make your rider lean.</p>
