<h2><span style="font-size: 24px;">Hack Day: Scratching our own itch</span></h2>
<p>Our Hack Day began with the decision to be our own target market and see how we could improve a couple pain points with a software solution.</p>
<!--more-->
<ul>
<li>First, we needed a roster to determine whose turn it is to put out the recycling bin, clean excess cheese off the toastie griller, and generally tidy up. It needed to be quick and easy both to see whose week it is, and to change the order if someone is going to be away.<br><br></li>
<li>Second, we needed a place to collect and share ideas. This was really a Hack Day metaproject: we'd discussed a bunch of ideas for Hack Day projects over the previous week but neglected to write them all down somewhere where we could find them again.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two projects meant two teams, so we split up and got to work.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 24px;">Getting past the magic</span></h2>
<p>Although we normally work in Rails and Objective-C, both teams decided to use&nbsp;<a title="https://www.meteor.com" href="https://www.meteor.com/" target="_blank">Meteor</a>, a&nbsp;platform written on top of <a href="http://nodejs.org" target="_blank">Node.js</a>. We'd been talking about JavaScript frameworks around the office for a while, debating the relative merits of&nbsp;<a title="https://angularjs.org" href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">Angular</a>,&nbsp;<a title="http://backbonejs.org/" href="http://backbonejs.org/" target="_blank">Backbone</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="http://emberjs.com" href="http://emberjs.com/" target="_blank">Ember</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 24px;">Meteor stood out as having a distinctly different approach from these other projects. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It does crazy data synchronization automatically, updates live while people are using your code, and generally looks like magic. But there's good magic and scary magic, and we all wanted to know what Meteor was like for real work.</p>
<p>Hack Day is ideal for experimenting with new open source tools: a real one-day project offers more insight than a tutorial, but is safer than committing to new technology for a client project.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 24px;">How do developers best use Meteor?</span></h2>
<p>As we worked, many of our questions weren't about how to use it, but how&nbsp;<em>best</em>&nbsp;to use it. How do Meteor coders normally organize their code? Which packages are best for different tasks? We were surprised at how easy it was to authenticate users, but also that core Meteor doesn't include a standard router.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 24px;">As the day proceeded, we found that working with Meteor felt a lot like the early days of Rails. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We were delighted at how productive we were, and got useful code written very quickly, but we also learned which aspects were works in progress.</p>
<span style="font-size: 24px;">Oh yeah? Well&nbsp;our&nbsp;app has gravatars.</span>
<p>Having two teams using the same platform made for an interesting dynamic. There was a little rivalry and heightened mystery about what the guys in the other room were doing. But we also found we made many complementary choices, and there was a lot of code in each app that could usefully be applied to the other.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, we'd built two simple and useful web applications and we knew a lot more about Meteor.</p>
