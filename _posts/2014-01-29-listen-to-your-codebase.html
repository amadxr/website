<p class="feature">Over the years I’ve been asked to evaluate an array of closed source codebases, many with several years' history. Without even running an application, I can identify a lot about the project state, the people involved, and the business behind it.</p>
 
<p>Your codebase and more importantly the version control history tells an incredible story. This history gives you a list chronological list of every change made and who made it.</p>
<blockquote>Looking through version control history is like reading someone’s diary. All the secrets are on the table.</blockquote>
<p>You find out the following right away</p>
<ul>
<li>How many developers have worked on the application? Individuals or teams?</li>
<li>What was the engagement like? In house, freelancers or a consulting company?</li>
<li>Who was there when the project started?</li>
<li>How much impact has each developer made on the project?</li>
<li>When was the majority of the project developed?</li>
<li>What’s the developer churn look like?</li>
<li>What’s the code quality like? Has it been hacked together or is it well factored? <a href="/blog/posts/code-for-success-focus-on-architecture" title="/blog/posts/code-for-success-focus-on-architecture">Is it well-architected or is it a mess?</a>
</li>
<li>How up to date are the dependencies within the project?</li>
<li><a href="/blog/posts/code-for-success-write-tests" title="/blog/posts/code-for-success-write-tests">Is there a test suite?</a>
</li>
<li>Have aspects of the codebase been replaced many times before?</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on what you’ve now learnt, you have to ask yourself the harder questions</p>
<ul>
<li>If no one seems to stick around on this project, why? Is it the business direction? The people? Was the state of the project beyond repair?</li>
<li>What level of skill did the developers that worked on it have? How well was the knowledge transferred through the team?</li>
<li>What security risks exist within the dependencies and the codebase itself?</li>
</ul>
<p>Next you can start to get a picture of the business</p>
<ul>
<li>Based on when and how many people were added you can estimate the development expenditure.</li>
<li>Has the project been hacked together possibly due to the way the development funding was spent? Or was there a lead developer that stuck around and took responsibility for the project’s health?</li>
<li>Who was the key person responsible for the technical aspects of the project and did they establish a clear direction?</li>
<li>Is it going to be easy to attract new developers to work on this project or is it dated and frustrating to work with?</li>
<li>Is there evidence of specific business problems within the codebase?</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that you know how to listen to your codebase, what is it saying about you?</p>
