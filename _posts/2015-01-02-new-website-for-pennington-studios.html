<p>We rarely do marketing websites these days but when Pamela Pennington asked us to create a new site for her <a href="http://www.pamelapenningtonstudios.com" title="http://www.pamelapenningtonstudios.com" target="_blank">award-winning interior design studio</a> we couldn't refuse. </p>
<p>With such a great portfolio and superb photography the main challenge is to stay out of the way. We partnered with Big Bite Creative in the U.K. to design this clean, understated site that lets the projects shine. </p>
<p>Given their location in Silicon Valley, a mobile friendly site is a particularly important requirement. So whether you view it on your phone or desktop the WOW! factor is undeniable.</p>
<blockquote>Thank you so much for a great job by you and your team. We're getting rave reviews for the new website, and pleased to have it on mobile devices. A great way to start the new year with a beautiful site to represent us.<br /><small>Pamela Pennington</small>
