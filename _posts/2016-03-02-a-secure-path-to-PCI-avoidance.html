<p class="feature editable">PCI compliance is a security standard designed to keep credit card information safe and prevent fraud. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) applies to companies of any size that accept credit card payments.</p>
<p class="editable">The problem is compliance can be difficult to achieve and hard to maintain. If your site doesn&rsquo;t meet the current standard you can be subject to large fines or denied the ability to process credit card payments.</p>

<h2 class="editable">The PCI Compliance Burden</h2>
<p class="editable">PCI DSS has a large scope: From websites to servers to the LANs and computers that come in contact with cardholder data. It's extremely specific and onerous.</p>

<h3 class="editable">Self-Assessment Questionnaire</h3>
<p class="editable">In attempting to achieve compliance you will need to complete a Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ). There are different types ranging from A to D (the most stringent).</p>
<p class="editable">You must complete and submit your questionnaire to your merchant bank annually. If you're not compliant you'll be required to develop and submit a plan to resolve any issues, along with time frames.</p>
<h3 class="editable">Application and Network Security Scan</h3>
<p class="editable">A regular security scan of your store and network will be conducted. This essentially runs a set of heuristics/rules that scan for red flags. If there are too many, or any that are too severe, action must be taken to move back into compliance. This must be done by an authorized scanning vendor and the report or certificate of compliance submitted to your merchant bank on a regular basis.</p>
<h3 class="editable">Data Center Compliance</h3>
<p class="editable">You must also make sure that the data center your site is hosted with is compliant. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/pci-dss-level-1-faqs/">Amazon AWS</a> is extremely good in this regard.</p>

<blockquote>When people ask us about becoming PCI compliant, we prefer to flip the question. What can we do about PCI avoidance?</blockquote>

<p class="editable">Our clients are often able to completely avoid PCI compliance. So you’re probably wondering how can you sidestep this burden? Before I tell you, let’s first understand how PCI compliance came about from a practical perspective.</p>

<h2 class="editable">An Evolution of Payment Implementations</h2>

<p class="editable">Let’s consider four alternatives for implementing payments on your store.</p>

<h3 class="editable">Solution 1: The Simplest Thing Possible</h3>

<p class="wide-image editable"><img src="/images/pci-compliance-solution-1.svg" class="no-border"/></p>

<p class="editable">In the early days of eCommerce you would often see solutions like this. From the developer standpoint it’s the easiest solution you could implement with traditional payment providers.</p>

<p class="editable">Credit details are stored in your database like everything else. You contact the payment provider with those details and get a response. You don’t bother setting up HTTPS to encrypt the transmission from the browser to your server.</p>

<p class="editable">It’s worth noting though that this flow is good in terms of developer time spent. It’s also good for the user because they stay on your site throughout the process.</p>

<p class="editable">However the issue with this solution is it's highly unsecure. Someone could intercept this information when it is transmitted or steal all the unencrypted credit card information stored in the database.</p>

<h3 class="editable">Solution 2: Payment Provider Hosted Payment Page</h3>

<p class="wide-image editable"><img src="/images/pci-compliance-solution-2.svg" /></p>

<p>In this solution, on payment you send your customer to a payment provider's hosted payment page. The customer fills out their details and information is sent encrypted to the payment provider for processing.</p>

<p class="editable">Payment providers love this solution. It allows them to have full control and confidence that credit card data is secure all along the way. There's very little risk for the store owner.</p>

<p class="editable">While this option is more secure, it forces your customers down a strange path. One moment they’re on your site, the next they’re on another site (that doesn’t look like the page they came from) and they’re asked to enter payment information. This disconnect will negatively impact your conversion rate.</p>

<p class="editable">Some payment providers try to reduce this confusion by allowing the store owner to customize the header and footer of the payment page to make it feel like you’re still on the original store website. Ultimately though this is just a compromise.</p>

<h3 class="editable">Solution 3: PCI Compliance</h3>

<p class="wide-image editable"><img src="/images/pci-compliance-solution-3.svg" /></p>

<p class="editable">With this solution credit card data is encrypted during every step of transmission and storage.</p>

<p class="editable">This solution has a nice user flow and is secure but as the store owner you are wholly responsible for maintaining PCI complaince. You will need to be competent with encryption, patches, server access and know how to respond to any incidents.</p>

<h3 class="editable">Solution 4: PCI Avoidance (recommended)</h3>

<p class="wide-image editable"><img src="/images/pci-compliance-solution-4.svg" alt="Payment processing flow without the need for PCI complaince" /></p>

<p class="editable">The customer’s credit card is sent directly to the payment provider. A token, (not the actual credit card data) is then stored in your database and a payment accepted message is sent back to the customer.</p>

<p class="editable">If someone where to get hold of the credit card token, they are not able to extract credit card data from it.</p>

<p class="editable">The payment provider is PCI compliant but you do not need to be. Why is that? Because no credit card data is transmitted or stored with you.</p>

<p class="editable">While being secure and avoiding PCI compliance, we’ve also given the customer a better user experience by staying on your site at all times.</p>

<h2 class="editable">Conclusion</h2>

<p class="editable">Use a payment provider that allows you to offer both a great user experience and avoid the need for PCI compliance.</p>

<p class="editable">If your store is running on Spree Commerce or Solidus, you’ll be using the <a href="http://activemerchant.org">Active Merchant</a> library to process payments. <strong>Payment processes such as <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a> and <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com">Braintree</a> offer modern payment solutions that allow you to avoid PCI compliance and are compatible with Active Merchant.</strong></p>

<p class="editable">Avoiding the need for PCI compliance means you can rest easy knowing your site is secure, your customers are happy, and you've succcessfully outsourced the burden PCI complaince to your payment provider.</p>
