<blockquote>
<p>Every single person, every single organization on the planet knows what they do, 100 percent. Some know how they do it...<br><br>But very, very few people or organizations know why they do what they do.<!--more--> And by “why” I don't mean “to make a profit.” That's a result. It’s always a result. By “why,” I mean: What’s your purpose? What’s your cause? What’s your belief? Why does your organization exist? Why do you get out of bed in the morning? And why should anyone care?</p>
