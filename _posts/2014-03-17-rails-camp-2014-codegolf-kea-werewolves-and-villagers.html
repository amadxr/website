<p class="feature">Each year in New Zealand we have a <a href="http://railscamps.com/" target="_blank">Rails Camp</a>. Developers from all over the world meet up for an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference" target="_blank">unconference</a> â€” an event where participants make up their own agenda and presentations. If you have something you want to talk about, you put the topic on a white board and people come if they're interested.</p>
 
<p>This year Rails Camp was held on the South Island, on the top of Mount Cheeseman skifield.</p>

<p>What a simply stunning vista!  I had opted to camp (rather than stay in the hostel) because I <a href="http://blog.psdavey.com/2014/02/09/kelly-range/" target="_blank">quite like camping and hiking</a> (or tramping as we call it here) and there's more space to spread out. What I hadn't properly factored in were these guys: mountain parrots called Kea.</p>
<p>I put up my tent and had a good nights sleep on the Friday night, but by Saturday afternoon they'd found the tent and were busily trying to open the zip and get in. Fortunately for me I was alerted, but I ended up having to take the tent down and only put it up just before going to bed. They still came back at 06:30 on the following mornings for another go at getting in. Very clever birds, but very annoying when you're trying to sleep!</p>
<p>The Code Golf competition was one of the highlights. The idea is that you have to write a solution to a problem in the smallest possible way. This generally means the solution is quite unreadable as you do not write expressive method names etc. For example, instead of writing <code>def calculate_invoice_total</code> to define a method which calculates the total of an invoice, you'd write <code>def c</code> saving 22 bytes in the process. </p>

<p>One participant, Daniel Fone, wrote a code golf competition server which he has  <a href="https://github.com/danielfone/railscamp-codegolf" target="_blank">open sourced on GitHub</a>. Everyone had 18 holes of golf, and as you submitted your solution, you would instantly be compared to all the others. It was heaps of fun, there was a reasonable amount of cheating done, and some really inventive solutions. My personal favourite was the  <a href="https://github.com/danielfone/railscamp-codegolf/blob/master/course/holes/04_99_bottles.rb" target="_blank">99 bottles of beer hole</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, no Rails Camp would be complete without multiple games of werewolves &amp; villagers (also known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_%28party_game%29#cite_note-onenightBGG-2" target="_blank">Mafia</a>). In this game you are given a card which says whether you're a werewolf, or a villager.</p>
<p>At night, the werewolves become active and kill a villager. During the day, the villagers try to work out who the werewolves are and then lynch them. It's a psychological thriller and a really fun way of getting to know your fellow developers. </p>
<p>Another brilliant Rails Camp, which also saw the creation of the official <a href="http://ruby.org.nz/" target="_blank">Ruby New Zealand</a> society, a momentous occasion.</p>
