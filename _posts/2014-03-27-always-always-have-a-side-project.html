<p>Most Ruby on Rails developers I know have a side project of their own to work on. Here are a few reasons why it's great to have a side project (that doesn't conflict with your day job).</p>
<!--more-->
<h3>Keeping Current with New Technologies</h3>
<p>There's always new technology, languages and frameworks to learn and experiment with. As a software engineer you often work on established codebases and it's impractical to use the latest frameworks etc. With your own side project, you can decide for yourself how to approach any particular problem. You can experiment with whatever you like.</p>
<h3>You Can Take as Long as You Like</h3>
<p>When you're working on a client's project you want to do as good a job as you can within the constraints of time and budget. But on your own side project you can take as long as you like and be as thorough as you like. This is especially true if your side project doesn't have paying customers to be taken care of.</p>
<p>My own side project, <a title="http://snowpool.org/countries/new-zealand#year=2013&amp;month=7&amp;day=1&amp;view=month" href="http://snowpool.org/countries/new-zealand#year=2013&amp;month=7&amp;day=1&amp;view=month" target="_blank">snowpool.org</a>&nbsp;is a carpooling site for getting to the ski fields. I started it seven years ago and re-wrote it twice (it was my introduction to Ruby on Rails). Snowpool now lists carpools almost every day during the season, and upwards of 600 visits a day.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Learning New Skills</h3>
<p>I've learned so much putting the site together: Ruby on Rails itself, testing, creating a mobile app, the basics of design, bringing in advertising. I've also presented at a few Meetups and improved my presentation skills in the process.</p>

Tim, whose own side project is <a title="https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/air-pipes-bagpipes-for-iphone/id490891516?mt=8" href="https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/air-pipes-bagpipes-for-iphone/id490891516?mt=8" target="_blank">Airpipes</a>&nbsp;(the best bagpipe app for the iPhone!), was a great tutor. The iOS app isn't complete yet, but it's getting there and is all <a title="https://github.com/snowpool/ios_native_app" href="https://github.com/snowpool/ios_native_app" target="_blank">open sourced on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, here's a video of Tim showing off his Airpipes app at <a title="http://www.resolvedigital.com/blog/posts/rails-camp-2014-codegolf-kea-werewolves-and-villagers" href="http://blog.resolvedigital.com/blog/rails-camp-2014-codegolf-kea-werewolves-and-villagers">Rails Camp 2014</a> - good times!</p>
