title: Getting started on a new project

<p>Good communication is absolutely essential for a successful project, so when we kickoff a new project we make sure our clients are always in the loop.</p>
<p>This is how we recently advised a client:</p>

<p>For an instant messaging system our team members use a native client that we keep open all the time. This is easier than trying to keep it around in a browser tab. Some of us use <a title="http://propaneapp.com/" href="http://propaneapp.com/" target="_blank">http://propaneapp.com</a>, others use <a title="http://giantcomet.com/flint" href="http://giantcomet.com/flint">http://giantcomet.com/flint</a>. There are also other clients for other platforms and other add-ons at <a title="http://campfirenow.com/extras" href="http://campfirenow.com/extras" target="_blank">http://campfirenow.com/extras</a>.</p>
<p>Something we also like to do on a project is hook Campfire up to <a title="https://github.com/resolve" href="https://github.com/resolve" target="_blank">Github</a>: then the Campfire room gets a notification when commits are pushed, pull requests opened/closed etc. It makes it easier for everyone to follow updates to the codebase.&nbsp;</p>
