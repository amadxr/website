<p>You just launched your new site. Time to kick up your feet and relax, right? Unfortunately not. Your site is going to need regular monitoring and maintenance. What sort of things should you keep on top of, and what are the risks if you don't?</p>

<h2>Security Updates</h2>
<p>First of all, to minimize the risk of your site getting hacked, it needs the current versions of the software it relies on. When security threats are announced, patches are also supplied. Your development team should immediately apply these patches to prevent your site from being&nbsp;hacked.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Threat -&nbsp;your site could go offline, you could lose all your files and your customer information could be stolen.</li>
<li>Recovery -&nbsp;restore from a backup and patch security holes immediately.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Downtime</h2>
<p>Every site is subject to downtime. On the rare occasions this occurs it is usually a hosting platform issue â€” often an outage with a service the platform depends upon. For example, if your site is hosted with Heroku, it might actually be an Amazon Cloud service that Heroku relies on which causes the downtime.</p>
<ul>
<li>Threat - your website goes offline or runs extremely slow for hours.</li>
<li>Recovery -&nbsp;hold tight and wait until the service that is down comes back online.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Over Capacity</h2>
<p>At any time, your site could be flooded with traffic because you just made national news. Although this might be a wonderful thing, your hosting may not be set up to cope with the high demand, so your site grinds to a halt.</p>
<ul>
<li>Threat -&nbsp;slow unusable site&nbsp;potentially&nbsp;making it completely unreachable during a popular time.</li>
<li>Recovery -&nbsp;increase hosting&nbsp;capacity.</li>
</ul>
