<p>A few weeks back we hosted the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Christchurch-iOS-Development-Meetup/events/206307962/" target="_blank">Christchurch iOS Meet Up</a>. It was great to see everyone!</p>
<p>With the release of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, Tim Ross took us through what Adaptive UI is, why it's important with the release of these new devices and how to adopt Adaptive UI in your iOS application.</p>
<p>If you weren't able to come, here's a recording of Tim's talk.</p>
