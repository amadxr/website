<p>The good news: Business is booming. The bad news: Youâ€™re starting to realize the shortcomings of your existing e-commerce platform.</p>

<p><img src="/images/spree-logo-blogpost.png" alt="spree logo magengto bigcommerce" />Whether you've been using Magento, Big Commerce or Shopify, it might be time to consider re-platforming to Spree Commerce. If your business is outgrowing your current platform you may be experiencing pain including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limited customization</li>
<li>Lack of integration options</li>
<li>Poor inventory management</li>
<li>Slow performance</li>
<li>No localization</li>
</ul>
