<p>The good news: Business is booming. <br /><br /> The bad news: Youâ€™re starting to realize the shortcomings of your existing e-commerce platform.</p>

<p><img src="/system/images/W1siZiIsIjIwMTQvMTEvMjcvMDAvNDkvMzIvOTY0L3NwcmVlX2xvZ29fYmxvZ3Bvc3QucG5nIl1d/spree-logo-blogpost.png" alt="spree-logo-blogpost" /><br />Whether you've been using Magento, Big Commerce or Shopify, it might be time to consider re-platforming to Spree Commerce. If your business is outgrowing your current platform you may be experiencing pain including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limited customization</li>
<li>Lack of integration options</li>
<li>Poor inventory management</li>

<li>No localization</li>
</ul>

<p>But re-platforming is a complicated business and of course it's imperative that the site migration be done right. </p>
