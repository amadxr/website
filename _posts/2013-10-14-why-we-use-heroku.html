title: Why We Use Heroku

<p><img style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px;" title="Heroku Logo" src="/system/images/W1siZiIsIjIwMTQvMTEvMjcvMDAvNDkvMzgvOTc5L2hlcm9rdV9sb2dvLnBuZyJdXQ/heroku-logo.png" alt="Heroku Logo" align="right" height="123" width="390">Clients sometimes ask why we're recommending hosting their sites on <a href="http://www.heroku.com" target="_blank">Heroku</a>. As a technical person it takes a bit of thought to explain what the benefits are to our often business minded clients.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Heroku fundamentally allows us to focus on building the <em>unique</em> parts of your application. We don't need to focus on deployment, scaling, security and hosting support. This saves us a lot of time, and saves our clients a lot of money.</p>
<p>It's easy for us to setup, scale, secure and connect many useful (often free) add-ons to your site such as automatic database backups and email sending services. The short term developer productivity gains combined with the long term hosting support and security benefits make it a great choice for many small to mid-size applications. Applications on Heroku are also very portable - need to add another developer to the project? Need to transfer the billing to another account? No problem.</p>
<p>Years ago we used to run our own Virtual Private Servers (VPSs). This was before cloud hosting options like Engine Yard and Heroku were around. Doing hosting ourselves meant one of our developers assumed the responsibilities of server admin; had to set it up with a Ruby on Rails stack and get deployments working. It was necessary to keep on top of security patches for the operating system and all other software dependancies. When it comes to scaling, it was entirely up to us to figure that out. This is a headache I'm glad we've been able to outsource.</p>
<p>We don't always recommend Heroku as it depends on your specific needs but in many cases it's our default.&nbsp;</p>
