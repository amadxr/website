<p>This week we watched a couple of RailsCasts episodes, and one in particular stood out as a must-see.</p>
<p><a title="http://railscasts.com/episodes/402-better-errors-railspanel" href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/402-better-errors-railspanel">Better Errors &amp; RailsPanel</a>&#160;shows off some excellent tools to make debugging exceptions a great deal easier in Rails.&#160;The Better Errors gem provides in-browser exception display and investigation with a huge amount of depth, including the ability to directly open the offending line of code in your editor, even lines within gems.&#160;</p>
<p>Judging by the excitement this part of the Railscast produced, this gem will be an automatic include in our future applications. RailsPanel is a Chrome plugin that allows us to see the Rails application requests and parameters within the developer console, instead of having to inspect server logs.</p>
<p>One of the new features of Rails 4.0 (to be released in the near future) is the <a title="http://railscasts.com/episodes/390-turbolinks" href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/390-turbolinks">Turbolinks</a>&#160;gem. This library uses javascript to replace the body and title of the webpage with the new target content when a link is clicked, instead of generating a full page reload.&#160;In most applications this will give a reasonable increase in speed, so it will be interesting to try this out.</p>
<p>The souvlakis were delicious too!</p>
