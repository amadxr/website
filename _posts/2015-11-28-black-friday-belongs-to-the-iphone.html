<p>Consumers using their iPhones were responsible for the record growth in online shopping, according to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/11/28/thanksgiving-online-sales/#.kwc1hnq:zf1d" target="_blank">Tech Crunch</a>. Mobile shopping accounted for an overall 34% share of Black Friday sales. Custora.com reports an even higher number, over 36%.</p>
<p>While tablets declined 2% from 2014. Smartphones generated a record 22% share of sales, 70% more than last year.</p>
<blockquote>Customers were far more likely to use their Apple device rather than Android. Nearly 78% of all mobile orders were made on Apple devices, according to Custora.</blockquote>
