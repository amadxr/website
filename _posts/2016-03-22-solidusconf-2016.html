<p>Find out where Solidus is today and where it’s going in the future. Among the presenters, <a href="https://twitter.com/d_jones" target="_blank">David Jones</a>, our Technical Director, will be speaking on “Machine Learning and eCommerce”.</p>
<p>Here's an outline of David's talk:</p>
<blockquote>
The typical off the shelf online store is not enough to compete in today’s market. Machine learning (ML) enables us to deliver a more targeted, personalised and engaging customer experience. I’ll guide you through the complex topic of ML and offer ideas and tips on how and where to apply it successfully.
